"An alternative version of the Sleeping Beauty problemSince lately, r/philosophy seems to have been interested in the Sleeping Beauty problem, I thought I'd share a related problem, which perhaps may shed some light on it by approaching it from a different angle. A while ago I posted [another problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/580lo2/the_possibility_of_quantum_immortality_is_either/) that caught a bit of attention. But, since it used quantum mechanics and the many worlds interpretation as one of its premisses, the focus shifted towards issues specifics to physics, which was not what I intended.

After reading the article on [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/7tn7z8/michael_g_titelbaum_ten_reasons_to_care_about_the/), which explicitly relates the sleeping beauty problem to quantum mechanics, I figured both problems may actually be the same, which means the problem I posted could be re-stated without any mention to quantum mechanics. This is exactly what I attempted to do here, which is basically something in between both problems:

A sedative will be administered to a friend or mine and me, which will keep us unconscious while the experiment is conducted. While we're unconscious, a robot will create 6 copies of myself (all of which will be identical to the original, including all the memories). There will also be 6 rooms, numbered 1 to 6, in which each of the clones will be placed (while they're still unconscious). The room number will be written inside of the room, so it'll be visible to the clones.

Each of these rooms will contain two beds, one for me and one for my friend. But she'll be cloned in a way determined by the results of flipping a coin and rolling a dice: 

* If the coin lands heads, 5 copies or her will be produced and they'll be placed in each room except one, which will be the room with a number equal to the result of the dice. 
* If the coin lands tails, 1 copy of her will be produced and will be placed in the room with a number equal to the result of the dice.

Assuming we were both fully aware of the details of the experiment before we were put to sleep, and so our clones also know all these details, suppose I wake up in room number 6 and I see my friend also waking up on a bed next to me. Now I have to guess whether the coin landed heads or tails. Out of the 12 possible outcomes, there are 6 alternatives in which I wake up on room 6 with my friend next to me: H/1, H/2, H/3, H/4, H/5 and T/6. So in 5 out of these 6 possibilities, the coin landed heads, which seems to imply that I should guess that the coin landed heads.

On the other hand, the only new information my friend, who's waking up next to me, has gained is that she's a clone and that she's in room 6. Before the experiment started, she knew that, if she woke up as a clone, she'd see some random number written on a wall (all with the same probability) next to a clone of me claiming that the coin most likely landed heads. So she doesn't seem to have any new reason to be inclined to believe that the coin landed heads. 

I only see these three alternatives:

1. We should both believe that the coin is more likely to have landed heads. If so, how about if she runs the experiment without me? Is the mere fact of waking up in any random room by herself a good reason to believe that the coin landed heads? 
	
2. We should both believe that the coin is not more likely to have landed heads. But then, if instead of a cloned friend I use a cloned banana, and instead of a 6 sided dice I used a 1000 sided dice and 1000 clones? Would it be equally likely for the coin to have landed tails and the dice to have landed my room number (out of 1000 possible numbers), than the coin to have landed heads and the dice to not have landed my room number (999 out of 1000)?
	
3. I should believe that the coin is more likely to have landed heads, but she should not. This is the weirdest alternative. Do I have any information that she doesn't, or the other way around? And if so, couldn't we just inform each other and, assuming we trust each other, reach an agreement? Or is this some kind of incommunicable information (from which nevertheless we can reach a communicable numerical conclusion)?"
"Tribal Prisoners Thought ExperimentYou are the leader of the Aqiri tribe in the ancient world. Every day is a struggle to survive, but you and your people have managed so far.

Your tribe has an old grudge with the Goru tribe. Each tribe has committed unjustified acts of wrongdoing against one another. You hear that the Goru tribe is preparing to go to war with your tribe. And that is exactly what happens.

The Aqiri and Goru warriors meet on the field of battle. The result would be best described as a ""draw,"" with both armies retreating.

Many Goru tribesmen die, but a vast number are taken as prisoners. It is unfeasible to restrain and sustain these prisoners for more than a day or two. Furthermore, the Goru have moved their settlement and cannot be found within any reasonable period of time.

What do you do with the prisoners?

Some options:

- Kill them.
- Enslave them, while otherwise treating them humanely.
- Free them, risking that they rejoin their tribe and attack again.
- Risk making some sort of deal and trusting them.
- [Your idea here.]"
"Can killing in the name of good be justified when innocents may also be harmed?During a sleepless night, I typed this out. It is a description of my internal conflict with being a contracted hacker for the government and the morality of my actions. 

**Background Info:**
I am 17. I work for a network security company that does contracting for the government. My work involves gaining access to a specific target using vulnerabilities in consumer devices. Since I do not a have a clearance I am given no information about the target.

**Start:**
I want to know I’m doing the right thing. Because what I do makes me a killer. Not directly, but ultimately what I do may or may not end someone else’s life. Work that I do with law enforcement can put a pedophile behind bars or work with the military can put a bullet through someone’s head in Afghanistan. It wasn’t like this before. Before, it was just the excitement of solving the puzzle, finding that one flaw that would give you unauthorized access. It didn’t feel quite real, at least not until the sudden realization that what I am doing actually affects people’s lives. The realization changes the “I just bypassed the security on that webcam” to “I just got a visual id on the target.” It’s been some months since I realized this and now I can’t stop asking myself the question: “Am I doing the right thing?” 

Personally, I do not believe that our government always makes the right decisions. Our elected officials are people just like us and are likely to make decisions that further their own agenda rather than do the “right” thing. Most of the time, there is no consensus on what the right thing is. There is so much conflict within the government that I cannot believe that without a doubt, the actions it makes are completely justified. What I do to help it can either be good or evil. Did hacking into some foreign computer network help the military kill someone? Maybe. Was he a terrorist? Who knows. I’d like to think that by providing the military with more information, I make it less likely for them to make a mistake, but I can’t be certain of that and I can’t be certain that the target deserved to die. 

So how do I justify my actions to help an entity that punishes people when my faith in its ability to do so fairly is lacking? I have to assume that it makes the correct decisions. I need to tell myself that when my software breaks into someone’s home network, that I am helping society by removing those who cause harm. I tell myself that each network I break into means that there is some little kid won’t be hurt. That one girl won’t have to live the rest of her life in silence and shame because she is scared to speak out. I pray that my work isn’t being abused to help spy on those who are innocent or worse, kill those who are innocent. It’s a huge burden that I place on a single assumption.  

I need to feel verification that I have done the right thing, that even if someone was harmed because of me, it was worth it because many more avoiding suffering. This need makes the words people that say to me have so much more meaning than they intend. Acceptance by others is verification that I have done the right thing while rejection proves that I have made a mistake. Hearing someone say that they trust me puts me in a blissful happiness. On the other hand, the words, “You’re not the right one for me. I just want to be friends” becomes a soul-crushing “You had good intentions, but you have made a terrible mistake and I can’t accept that.” Being aware of my unwarranted translation does nothing to mitigate the feelings it stirs up. I vividly remember a breakup where I was told, “I feel like you are using your depression to take advantage of me.” The shock that put through me was enormous. I had been able to feel like I was doing the right thing by demonizing rapists, pedophiles, generally anyone who takes advantage of others for sex. Now, to be heard that I was one, completely ripped my mind apart. Someone that I cared for did not want to be with me because she thought I was one of them. The rest of the day was spent contemplating quick and painless ways of suicide while a friend ineffectively tried to convince me that it wasn’t true. Honestly, the only thing that saved me was probably the fact that I felt so useless that I couldn’t bring myself to do anything.

Dealing with people has an extra level of difficulty, especially with people who don’t quite understand what I do. It seems that whenever people at school talk about me, the subject is always how much money I make. I have even had several people I do not normally talk to come up to me and inquire about my yearly salary. One such person even friend requested me on Facebook shortly after asking. This question disgusts me. My work decides if people live or die and people’s main concern is gossiping over how much money I make? Is only my pay important? How about catching those pedophiles, is that important? Is it worth the damage I might cause? Am I causing other people’s deaths for the money? I hope not. Just the idea of it sickens me. So I started using a large portion of my paycheck to buy toys for kids in hospitals. I remember when I was learning to program, my brother was in the hospital. The everyday before visiting him, I would frantically be programming a game to let him play on my laptop when I went to visit. He was so excited when he got to play my simple board game. I hope the money I got from my gamble at least brings a smile to others like the one my brother had. At least this helps me hold on to what sanity I have, but the toll this conflict is having on me is becoming more apparent.

I go through most days robotically. I wake up in the morning, go to school, go to work, go home, pass out, then stay up all through the night. Why? Sleep is a curse. I only sleep when my body can no longer handle being awake any longer since my dreams are painful. Some nights I dream of being punished for the fates I’ve brought to others, some nights I dream that I can no longer handle it and kill the ones I know who are guilty, and some nights I dream I am back in the asylum where I belong. If I am lucky, I don’t dream. I am in a different state of mind every day. I may go a few days feeling on top of the world while, on other days, I feel wretched and useless. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone. I can’t stand being unable to control my thoughts and feelings. I can’t help but let my personal relationships be intertwined with my conscience. My aim has always been to protect those who cannot protect themselves and spread happiness to those who suffer. The constant conflict in my mind leaves me lost and confused. I am sorry to those around me that I hurt because I am blind and those who I do not know because I am mistaken. Am I doing the right thing? Did I make the right choice?"
"Why We're All Going to Die“Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”- John F. Kennedy

 

The only way out is through. Global society is dependent on artificially inflated energy resources—i.e. oil—that are directly leading us toward total collapse. Technology is being used to most efficiently maximize wealth of the largest corporate conglomerates at the expense of the social fabric and a living environment. The biosphere is in fact collapsing. The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

[iv] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"Humans and Artificial Intelligence Can't Form Real Friendships (Yet). Can humans and artificially intelligent robots form friendships? To explore this question, the term 'friendship’ must be defined. Many definitions of friendship are inspired by Greek philosopher Aristotle. He argues that friendships are characterized by the utility and pleasure that can be gained from a relationship, as well as the sharing of virtues and ideals. These criteria may seem to convey that friendships are motivated by self-interest. However, while the principles of utility and pleasure imply that friendships are founded on self-interest, the final principle of virtue sharing lies in the benefits they bestow on the participants. They aren’t necessarily mutually enriching. The final principle of virtue sharing conveys that friendships are different from other kinds of relationships because they require mutual benefit.

To examine if humans can form friendships with inanimate objects that emulate human life, two cases will be presented to establish a concrete example of how humans can form relationships with inanimate objects that resemble human life. The first case involves a man from Michigan who is married and claims to have a mistress, although neither of them are human. They are synthetic, robotic dolls. The man from Michigan promotes love with artificial beings and claims that they are happy together.

The second case involves a military bomb-disposal robot that was destroyed on a battlefield in Iraq. He was given a formal military funeral and was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star medallion. The soldiers working with the robot felt they owed him the respect of proper military recognition. The soldiers claim that the robot developed a personality of its own and he had saved their lives on many occasions.

These kinds of experiences are not exceedingly uncommon and illustrate the notion that humans can form powerful emotional attachments to non-living objects, especially if they resemble humans or human behavior. Even simple, non-living objects such as photographs of loved ones that have passed away can carry strong emotional sediment. Concerning robots, humans can certainly fulfill Aristotle’s criteria of utility and pleasure from machines, as their creation is meant to fulfill these very purposes. However, to determine whether a robot benefits from a relationship with a human, the desires of the robot should be examined. Robots don’t seem to possess any desires at all. They are machines devoid of free will. Therefore, in their current state, robots can’t fulfill Aristotle’s notion of virtue sharing and mutual benefit.

The developments of ‘artificial intelligence’ are meant to fulfill the theory of computer systems being able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. The question of if friendships can ever truly be formed between humans and robots is reliant on determining if robots can ever become truly alive, which suggests that robots would possess free will, their own desires, and autonomy. The criteria and classification of life according to leading modern secular thought are as follows: “All life is highly ordered and structured; all life reproduces itself; all life grows and develops to reach maturity; all life takes in and utilizes energy to carry out the functions of its components, which results in growth and development; all living things exhibit homeostasis; all living things respond to their environment by sensing external stimuli and changing their body to fulfill a behavior; and, finally, all living things adapt to external pressures, and evolve because of them.”

While this list of characteristics may be incomplete or contested by various demographics, such as religious groups or other such conflicting philosophies, it can be argued that artificial intelligence will soon be able to accomplish all of these characteristics, as programs such as viruses are already able to proliferate, reproduce, utilize energy, and so forth. In light of this prediction, robots should then be assessed as to whether they truly experience a desire to form a friendship with a human and recognize any mutual benefits. So long as artificial intelligence functions by a set of behaviors originated by their initial programming, it can be argued that robots can never satisfy this mutually satisfying condition because robots can never have truly autonomous free will. They wouldn't truly express desires, as they don’t have their own values or beliefs. In this sense, the characteristics of life in a robot could be thought of as deceptions that mislead us as to the true nature of the robot. In this sense, a higher form of life capable of forming friendships can be characterized by free will and autonomy, as well as the conventional characteristics of life.

In conclusion, so long as robots obey a set of behaviors as determined by computer programming rather than the innate mechanisms that bring forth free will and autonomy, this essay concludes that the developments of artificial intelligence is not currently sufficient for humans to develop ‘friendships’ with robots, according to Aristotle's definition of friendship. The driving force that compels humans to possess free will and autonomy currently seem to be incompatible with the driving forces of artificial intelligence that emulate life. The criterion of mutual benefaction isn’t fulfilled. The emotional attachments humans feel towards robots perhaps could instead be classified by other forms of relationships rather than ‘friendship’."

"Defeating the ""what about humans?"" argument for veganismMany people have effectively argued that we shouldn't eat meat from factory farms or other farms where animals are raised in bad conditions. For the purposes of this post I'll just assume this position.

But some go further and argue that it is wrong even to raise an animal for food in a good environment. Even if its life is good with positive well-being, it's still wrong to create such animals, therefore animal farming is always wrong. This doesn't make a lot of sense on its face: it's *good for* the animal, it has a *happy* life, how can it be wrong to kill it? But the vegans have a defense: imagine if they did this to humans. Would you support raising humans and then killing them for food? Of course not! It's barbaric! And so the vegan wins the argument.

There is one line of response to this which says that humans deserve rights which animals don't. Even though both animals and humans are moral patients, and both deserve not to suffer unnecessarily, humans (and whatever rare or hypothetical animals happen to have human-like levels of rational thinking, social standing, cognition, etc) also have special rights not to be raised and slaughtered. Thus, it's consistent to say that it's wrong to farm humans but not wrong to (humanely) farm animals.

That's one response, which I won't go into here. Agree or disagree with it at your leisure. Instead I will show how we can respond to the vegan argument while preserving a fully welfare-oriented perspective. And the first way to do that is to simply deny the assumption that farming humans would be wrong.

We can take it for granted that doing this in *reality* doesn't make sense: there would be too many social problems, it would be extremely economically inefficient, etc. Even if we allowed, say, consenting parents to produce and slaughter an infant, that would generate enough pure outrage and family tension to far outweigh the minor nutritional and gustatory benefits. 

However, let's imagine a world where people can be raised for food and it actually 'works'. E.g., suppose that aliens have watch over the Earth and they beam people away for euthanasia as they get older, something universal and predictable just like natural old age death. And suppose the aliens had planted humans on Earth just for this purpose. Is that better than Earth being an empty world? To me, it seems like it is better. I would rather live on such a world than have no life at all. 

Also, there is no need to restrict our focus to meat. Humans (and animals) could be raised and sacrificed for a wide number of things. For instance, it could be for organs - which I think we can commonly agree is no different from being raised and sacrificed for meat, except for the fact that organs are more important (they could save lives).

More interestingly, humans could be raised for sacrifice in other ways. Imagine that you are a Star Wars clone trooper who is tasked with guarding a robotic mining operation on another planet. Your job is for economic purposes rather than saving people's lives, you could be killed instantly by a surprise strike (suppose it is inevitable given enough time), but until then you have a decent life, almost no labor and enjoy just hanging around. Is it wrong that the mining company had you cloned, even as you are personally glad for it? I don't see this as the case. Of course, you might prefer an *even better* life (don't we all), but that doesn't change the basic fact that your life is better than nonexistence. Alternatively, rather than being raised for sacrifice, you could be raised for your labor (e.g. you are a cloned miner), still with a better life than nonexistence.

In logical terms, it sure seems like these things are morally equivalent to raising humans for meat, but they don't feel as wrong. How do we square these intuitions? Maybe raising humans for meat and labor are both wrong, or maybe they are both right. Either is possible, but this new perspective does make it easier to accept that raising humans for meat is right. It is no longer the stuff of absurdity, because the alternative is to take the mildly objectionable position that these mining operations are wrong.

But there is a way to draw a moral distinction between the two cases. Combat and mining and other pursuits befit the capacities of a human. Of course they are not perfect, they are not fully utilizing our human abilities. But for practical purposes, they come reasonably close. You need human intelligence and human dexterity to perform these tasks. On the other hand, raising a human for food does *not* befit human capacities. Our human strengths and abilities go unused as we are relegated to doing something that animals could do. Thus, being a soldier or a miner provides a kind of *objective* well-being that we lack when we are playing the role of livestock.

So we could say that farming humans is wrong. Does this condemn humane animal farming? No! Because if we want to be consistent, we must judge animal farming by whether it befits *their* capacities, not human ones. To be sure, even on a humane farm, animals are not completely fulfilling all their roles and making use of all their unique abilities. But that is true for the human soldiers and miners anyway. These humans utilize their capacities to a *decent degree*, and humanely raised livestock utilize their capacities to a *decent degree* (they eat, they grow, they run around, etc). When you combine this with perfectly adequate pleasure and little amount of pain, things are good overall. Things don't have to be perfect in order to be good.

In summary, there are two viable ways to provide a welfarist response to the vegan *reductio ad absurdum* against humane farming. The first is to outright deny that farming humans is, in principle, a bad thing. The second is to say that humans raised for food will necessarily have less *objective well being* than animals who are raised for food, because they are not being raised for the capacities befitting their species. When humans are economically raised purely for a purpose that does befit our species capacities (such as combat or mining), that is morally equivalent to humane animal farming, and both are better than nonexistence."
"Critique my explanation for why Free Will isn't plausibleThird Draft (Same as Second with Add-on)

Preface: I'm referring to the monotheistic idea of Free Will: That we act independently of the laws of nature and the preceding series of events that go back to the Big Bang.  

My Motivation: The Christian God, for example, judges us for our sins.  The issue I see with this is he, presumably, made the universe and therefore he 'wrote the script' to all of the actions we'll take in our lives.  I'd even argue that he's responsible for those sins.   

If I had the knowledge of Laplace's Demon (Everything in universe) and I created a robot, knowing it would commit heinous acts in reaction to future circumstances, I'm responsible for those actions because I KNEW, arguably even intended (why else would I create the robot with this knowledge), creating this specific robot would lead to it doing such things.

**Argument against Free Will**
*All credit to /u/Fibonacci35813 for his well articulated philosophical arguments* 
P1: The behavior of all matter is determined by antecedent condition together with the natural laws and cause and effect.
P2: Humans (and subsequently their brains and body) are made up of matter.
P3: Thoughts and behavior are the function of the brain and the body.
C: Thoughts and behavior are the function of antecedent condition together with the natural laws and cause and effect.
Now, one might question the first premise and argue that some matter is probabilistic or perhaps even random.
Ok, so here is an additional premise:
P1b - If matter is not determined by antecedent condition together with the natural laws and cause and effect, then it is determined by probablisitc determinism and/or randomness.
But then you get the conclusion:
Cb: Thoughts and behavior are the function of randomness or probabilistic determinism.

Further Elaboration: If we're composed of matter, we're subject to the laws of nature.  We haven't come far enough in neuroscience to predict someone's behavior from the state of each individual, of roughly 100 billion, neuron.  We do know, however, that neurons are composed of atoms.  We also know atoms act according to physical laws.  We know that what each atom does at any given time is determined from the beginning of the universe.  We know that if we knew the state of every atom in the universe in one frame of time, then we can predict the state of every atom in the universe at ANY other frame of time in the future and similarly calculate the state of every atom in the universe at ANY other frame of time in the past.  That means with such knowledge, we could know the state of everything emergent from atomic physics, including the state of our bodies and the emergent processes of our bodies, our minds.  We'd be able to know this because every state of the universe is brought about by the prior state.  Here's a simple example, you know a meteor flying through space is travelling at 8000 m/s in a given direction and there's no matter anywhere remotely close enough to affect this meteor in any way, you can then predict a second from now that meteor will be 8000 meters, in that given direction, from where it was a second ago because its state a second ago determined its state a second in the future.  You can complicate this scenario all you want, if you knew all the parameters of its state and the laws of physics you'd know where it was at any time before and any time thereafter.  

Humans are incredibly complicated. There's roughly 100 billion neurons interacting in the brain, there's 5 ways for the brain to collect information on the current physical circumstances (our senses), and those neurons interpret that information and compute an output not just on current circumstances but past circumstances stored, however accurately (not perfect), within certain neurons.  You deactivate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and your behavior changes because your brain can no longer inhibit the influence emotional information has on the computations for behavior.  You deactivate any other part of the brain and you have similar results: behavior changes.  Deactivating the amygdala for example, results in fear and memories of fear no longer being calculated into behavior.  There's an interaction between the Dorsal Raphe Nuclei and the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex that makes us feel we have control over a situation that, if interrupted, make us feel as though there's no possible escape: The elephant tied to a wooden stake planted in the ground never tries to escape even though they could easily force their way free.  Similarly, if you put a rat in a hamster wheel that doesn't deactivate shocks being delivered to its tail through rotation, then place that same rat in a hamster wheel that deactivates those shocks upon rotation, that rat, in most cases, doesn't even attempt to rotate the wheel.  Now, these are simple, macroscopic level experiments, but imagine if we manipulated which neurotransmitters bind to each receptor site of each individual neuron of the 100 billion along with the exterior circumstances and memories of a human.  Also, Imagine you designed the DNA of this human and knew all the epigenetic factors and how to manipulate them.  You could then, likely, control their every action.  

Add-On:  Now, I can say with high probability, there are people with higher IQ's than I, that believe in Libertarian free will. However, what I noticed in many responses is a lack of understanding of the very essential and, I'd argue, necessary concept of emergence. I mean, without understanding emergence, you simply cannot hope to grasp many of the more complicated questions of reality.

Firstly, what is emergence? To quote Sean Carroll, ""the idea that there are multiple theories/languages/vocabularies/ontologies that we can use to usefully describe the world, each appropriate at different levels of coarse-graining and precision."" 

What does he mean by 'different levels of coarse-graining and precision'? An example relevant to my free will argument would be 'biology is at a more coarsely-grained level than chemistry and atomic physics is at a more precise level than chemistry.' This is to say 'biology is at a level emergent from the level chemistry occupies which is emergent from the level of atomic physics'. 

Why is this important to understanding reality? Well, for example, someone might say 'a total understanding of atomic physics tells you NOTHING about how the brain works (neuroscience)'. In fact, many if not most people reason exactly like that. Well, you'd be correct to say 'a total understanding of atomic physics does not give us a total understanding of how the brain works'. However, it DOES tell us some ways in which the brain CAN'T work.

Okay so with a complete theory of atomic physics, Core Theory, given the overwhelming probability it's correct, what can we derive to be a false idea about how the brain works? The brain cannot function independent of the universe. If the brain cannot function independent of the universe then there is no possibility for libertarian free will, which is, to quote John Hendrix, ""the ability to perform some other action in place of the one that is actually done"". So when you make a choice, you could NOT have made any other choice. There's a logical scenario where libertarian free will can exist: The atoms that compose the human brain do not abide by the laws of physics. I can't disprove this. I can point to the lack of a good reason to believe it any more than that reality is an illusion and that '2+2=4' is illogical, which are equally empirically unlikely. 

What about compatabilism? Compatabilism is certainly plausible, but that's because it only proposes the emergent IDEA of free will. I'd argue that compatabilists are talking about something different than libertarians and determinists. In fact, a determinist that understands emergence, would probably say the compatabalist version of Free Will, to once again quote Sean Caroll, ""is as real as baseball"". Baseball is certainly real, but it's certainly not as fundamental as biology. In fact, the idea of free will is probably a function of consciousness which is a function of the brain and if you find that hard to swallow because you're , unfortunately, of the popular opinion that we know NOTHING about consciousness and that it's this huge unsolvable mystery, do some web surfing for neuroscience studies on consciousness and I guarantee you, your opinion will shift to 'there's more we don't know than do know but there are some things that we know'.

One study I think is relevant to this topic of free will is Libet's study on voluntary actions. The action potential cascading to the subsequent action occurred .55 seconds before the action. The 'decisive' thought for this action occurred .2 seconds before the action; that's .35 seconds after the action was bound to occur. Sounds a lot like the action was computed and THEN we thought and felt we chose it and THEN the action was done.    

            "
"Here's why debates about free will have more to do with semantics than logic...The endless debates on free will among intelligent people are troubled mostly by a lack of any agreement on what free will actually means. It seems to be more about semantics than anything else.

When people talk of individual freedom, many things come to mind. Of primary importance is the question of whether you are free to do what you want to do. 

Someone locked in a room tied in a straight jacket is clearly less free than you are at this moment. You are more free because you have more options. 

In a broader sense, we can say that a free society is more valuable than  an oppressed society precisely because one is more able to do as they wish. Few would argue that this freedom is worth having.

But is this truly what it means to be free?

**Options**

In a recent discussion on free will, Dan Dennett, one of the world's most renown philosophers of consciousness, proposed the following scenario: 

Imagine a chess program that contains a flaw that limits the movement of its queen to only one square at a time. (1)

This limitation would considerably decrease its chances of winning against a program of comparable strength without this flaw. In fact, if given the opportunity to gamble on a series of games, you'd be crazy not to put all your money on the program without the flaw.

Yet look at what's really the difference here. One program has more ""freedom"" of moves than the other solely on the basis that its queen is not constrained. But is this kind of freedom really what we think of when we talk of free will? 

Hardly. We know each program is fully tied to its data. Every move is merely a calculation predetermined by its programming. If you could understand its code, you could predict its move in every sense. 

Thus by any genuine sense of the word, no one would attribute freedom to this program, despite one being described as more free than the other. 

Isn't what's really important far more significant than just having more options?

**Control**

Perhaps we should define genuine freedom as having some sense of control. When we are free, we are able to influence the behavior of things or the course of events. This would seem a sensible way to differentiate between the type of freedom you and I have versus that of a chess playing computer.

Yet this also has issues related to semantics. As Dennett explains, if a pilot gives up control of the plane to an auto pilot program, then the program designed to run that auto pilot is, by all definitions, controlling the plane in that moment. 

This is true, made evident by the fact that the pilot could be sleeping while the auto pilot navigates the plane, a situation where the pilot is clearly not in control of the plane.

Yet is an auto pilot program ""free"" in any useful sense of the word? Isn't it just as tied to the data as the chess playing program? 

It seems control isn't enough either. We need something better than control to convey the type of freedom we have. But if having options and control is not enough to illustrate genuine freedom, then what is?

**Desire**

Perhpas the missing ingredient that demonstrates genuine freedom is the ability to act on one's desires. 

This would surely differentiate the type of control we have over that of an autopilot. For as much as it is in control of the plane, it is not doing this because it wants to, it does so because its programmed to fly. It has no desires. 

So we can say that the freedom we attribute to ourselves that genuinely differentiates us from a computer program is not simply having more options, or having the ability to do as we wish, its the ability to have those wishes in the first place. 

Options, control, and desire. No sensible human would suggest we don't have all three. So why isn't this case closed?

**Genuine Freedom**

The reason is that for many, its not enough to simply say we can act on our desires. That's top level stuff. What's really important is the root of those desires. Our thoughts. 

Famed German Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer noted this issue almost two centuries ago when he said, *""Man can do what he wants but he cannot want what he wants.""* (2)

Isn't genuine freedom of will best defined as the ability to consciously originate and control our own thoughts and desires? Consider what it would mean to not have this ability. 

Suppose every thought you had all day was merely placed into your mind by your neighbor. Though you would be aware of the thoughts entering your consciousness and could follow along with the process of deliberation, you would have no control over any thought. 

In such a scenario, you'd be at the behest of your neighbors desires. In what possible way would anyone describe this situation as being free? Thus consciously initiating our thoughts is genuine freedom.

**Initiating Thoughts**

Luckily, though we're susceptible to influence, no other person is in control of our thoughts. But are we consciously initiating our own thoughts?

It sure seems so that way. Yet there's no logical manner to demonstrate the ability to consciously initiate a thought because for that to be possible, you'd have to think a thought before you thought it. 

There is no logical way to consciously author our own thoughts because each thought either pops into our consciousness for reasons we're not aware of, or they each require a thought of their own. 

Though it may feel like we are consciously originating our thoughts, the idea is nonsensical.

**The Endless Loop**

And thus we end up with two distinct ideas of free will that keep the world's top thinkers endlessly debating. It ultimately comes down to what you value.

If the ability to make choices and to follow your own desires is how you define free will, then surely have it. 

But if you value the notion of consciously originating your thoughts, actions, and desires, there is no logical manner in which free will is possible. You cannot think a thought before you think it.

It's a game of semantics. How you define free will is really what determines your position. There is nothing wrong with either view, you merely must choose what elements you value most.

"I'm Hilary Lawson, Director of the Institute of Art and Ideas, Founder of the HowTheLightGetsIn festival and post-realist philosopher. AMA!Hi reddit, I'm Hilary Lawson - post-realist philosopher, director of
the Institute of Art and Ideas and founder of the world's largest
philosophy and music festival [HowTheLightGetsIn](https://hay.htlgi.iai.tv).

Born and raised  in Bristol, England, I was awarded a scholarship to study
PPE at Balliol College Oxford . As a post-graduate I came to see paradoxes
of self-reference as the central philosophical issue and began a DPhil on
The Reflexivity of Discourse. This later became the basis for my first
philosophical book *Reflexivity: The Post-Modern Predicament*.

Alongside my more philosophical writing, I also pursued a media career
following my studies. Within a few years I had created my own prime time
television series 'Where There's Life' with a weekly UK audience in excess
of ten million. In 1982, I went on to co-author a book based on the series
and  was appointed Editor of Programmes and later Deputy Chief Executive
at the television station TV-am.

Meanwhile I continued to develop my philosophical thinking and had initial
sketches of the theory later to become Closure. In 1985 I wrote
*Reflexivity: The Post-Modern Predicament* as part of a series on modern
European thought. In the book, I argued that the paradoxes of
self-reference are central to philosophy and drive the writings of
Nietzsche, Heidegger and Derrida.

In the late 1980s I founded the production company TVF Media which made
documentary and current affairs programming, including Channel 4's
flagship international current affairs programme, The World This Week. I
was editor of the programme, which ran weekly between 1987 and 1991. The
programme predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall, the war in Yugoslavia and
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, amongst its other laudable achievements.

In the 1990s, I focused on writing [*Closure*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Closure-Story-Everything-Hilary-Lawson/dp/0415136504). It took a decade to complete
and was published in 2001. The book has been described as the first
non-realist metaphysics. Having begun my philosophical career as a
proponent of postmodernism, latterly I became a critic arguing for the
necessity of an overall framework and the need to move on from a focus on
language.

Closure proposes that the human condition is to find ourselves on the cusp
of openness and closure. The world is open and we, along with other living
organisms, are able to apprehend and make sense of it through the process
of closure. I would define closure as the holding of that which is
different as one and the same. Human experience is seen to be the result
of successive layers of closure, which I consider to be preliminary,
sensory and inter-sensory closure. The highest level of closure,
inter-sensory closure realises language and thought. The theory shifts the
focus of philosophy away from language and towards an exploration of the
relationship between openness and closure. An important element of the
theory of closure is its own self-referential character.

I founded the [Institute of Art and Ideas](https://iai.tv/) in 2008 with the aim of making
ideas and philosophy a central part of cultural life. Our website IAI.tv,
which posts to the sub, was launched in 2011. We then moved to publishing
articles in 2013 and free philosophy courses on [IAI Academy](https://iai.tv/iai-academy/courses) in 2014.

"Artificial intelligence and work: The future of economyThe increasing automation of the economy is frightening to some, and exciting to others.  No matter which side you stand on, AI presents the same general problems:
1. AI ""takes jobs."" Not only the job it is meant to replace, but whole supply chains
2. The change is happening now and will continue to occur exponentially
3. Change will not be instantaneous, requiring constant adaptation
4. Some of the economic problems we see now will only get worse unless we change the underlying system of our economy

1. One of the first industries automation started affecting was manufacturing.  Repetitive, physical jobs are easy to replace with robotics.  Unfortunately, when more manufacturing jobs are replaced, it starts to take away demand for other jobs as well.  Trade Union reps, floor managers, even time card producers (for those companies who haven't switched to online time stamping), and countless more minute industries feel the ripple that automation creates.  The impact of AI is much deeper than a few thousand jobs here and there.

2. As previously mentioned, automation has been in manufacturing for quite some time, and AI continues to change the job landscape.  Apps do things cheaper and more efficiently than really any person could.  Even the medical industry is being taken over.  I mean, who would want a human surgeon that fails 1% of the time over a robot that fails .001% of the time?  The economy is constantly becoming for automated, and with the exponential advancement of technology, the impact only widens over time.

3. Similar to the industrial revolution, however, the AI revolution creates plenty of jobs while it takes away others.  Coding is becoming a required course in plenty of high schools across America.  Resources are still needed to manufacture robots.  This makes the AI revolution a gradual change, yet it will differ from the industrial revolution in a few aspects.  AI and robotics are not just making labor easier, like the machines of the industrial revolution did.  They are replacing the labor altogether.  In many cases, robots are the ones manufacturing robots.  Watson, the IBM supercomputer, is constantly running algorithms and constantly improving on itself.  Plenty of AI systems are creating AI on their own.  Although plenty of other jobs are being created through the AI revolution, the result will not be zero-sum.  The greatest likelihood is that labor will be greatly reduced in availability and therefore forever changed by AI.  

4. A myriad of economic problems in our society stem from the power structure behind it, and that will continue with AI unless we make drastic change.  The people producing robotics and AI are not those whose jobs are being replaced, but rather the owners of companies who can afford to invest heavily in AI and the building of robots.  Fortunately, many of those tech company execs and uber-rich have plenty of ideas on how to deal with the coming ""AI takeover.""  Elon Musk has recently founded a new company, dubbed ""Neurolink"" which will begin to research the possibility of molding one's mind to a computer in order to upload and download thoughts.  Musk calls it the next step towards a more cyborg-like existence (which he claims has already begun with the introduction of smartphones).  Musk, along with other public figures like Bill Gates, have also voiced their support for a universal basic income, or UBI, to jump-start the transition towards a more AI reliant future.  The idea here is that more people can ride in the economic cart if robots are the ones pulling it.  If jobs will exponentially decrease in the future, then a capitalist economy is therefore unsustainable, and our transition must be towards what could be likened to socialism and possibly (in the very distant future) communism.  The primary concern then should be allowing that transition while preventing the problems those economic systems have encountered in the past.  

There are voices out there who claim that a life without work will be a life without meaning.  They say that we will no longer have a reason to get up in the morning.  My answer to this is predictive in nature.  It starts with a look at the industries that are gaining demand with younger generations.  In an article by Forbes (link at bottom), the importance of the ""Artisan Economy"" is highlighted.  Artisans not only work as fantastic poverty reducers, but also are made of people who love what they do (in most cases) because the quality of their work is directly related to the care they put into it.  There is also a high demand for handmade products, even in industries you don't think of as artisan (ever heard of specialty coffee?).  The increase in demand for human influence creates a better situation for the transition towards AI.  This might seem counter-intuitive, but think that at least for the time-being, jobs will not altogether disappear, but they will be greatly reduced.  A future where having a job is not a necessity allows one to do what they love, and it requires them to cater to those that want a product made by a human (sound like anything?).  The Artisan Economy, will be what survives --and even thrives-- after the AI revolution.  Therefore, no one should fear a future of poverty and disparity, but rather focus on transitioning to an existence of loving the work that they do, where day to day activities are hobbies rather than work.  Be warned, however, that we must be willing, ready, and able to adapt as our economy changes, or else we will create the world that we so fear.

"Why We're All Going to Die“Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”- John F. Kennedy

 

The only way out is through. Global society is dependent on artificially inflated energy resources—i.e. oil—that are directly leading us toward total collapse. Technology is being used to most efficiently maximize wealth of the largest corporate conglomerates at the expense of the social fabric and a living environment. The biosphere is in fact collapsing. The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"""The Symbol Grounding Problem"" (Floridi 2011) [x-post from /r/philosophyOfInfo]Luciano Floridi has offered a solution to the symbol grounding problem by identifying a condition that must be met in order to satisfy the SGP, called the ""Z-condition"", and claiming that no existing computational model satisfies the Z-condition.

What follows is a summary of chapter six of ""The Philosophy of Information"", but please note that the majority of this content is contained in the following self-contained PDF (so you don't need to read the book or really be familiar with the Philosophy of Information to join in this discussion):

http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2542/1/sgpcrfyr.pdf

Because this is of interest to the larger philosophy community, I am cross posting the entirety of the chapter summary (which is almost a word-for-word duplicate of the pdf), but again note that all of the necessary information is contained in the above PDF. Since this is cross-posted to multiple subreddits, I invite you to join us in the main discussion thread at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyOfInfo/comments/2v3oyl/chapter_6_discussion_thread_the_symbol_grounding/

SUMMARY

- Floridi wants to show ""what it means for data to be meaningful and for meaningful data to be truthful"", and that all 
- He introduces the ""Zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition), as the requirement that must be satisfied by a strategy in order to provide a valid solution of the SGP [symbol grounding problem, previously referred to in this book as the data grounding problem]"".

6.1 INTRODUCTION

- SGP - ""How can the data, constituting semantic information, acquire their meaning in the first place? ... The SGP concerns the possibility of specifying *precisely how* a formal symbol system can *autonomously* elaborate its own semantics for the symbols (data) that it manipulates and do so *from scratch*, by interacting with its environment and other formal symbol systems.""
- ""the difficulty is not (or at least, not just) merely grounding the symbols or data somehow successfully, as if all we were looking for were the implementation of some sort of internal look-up table ... the interpretation of the symbols (data) must be *intrinsic* to the symbol system itself, it cannot be *extrinsic,* that is, *parasitic* on the fact that the symbols (data) have meaning for, or are provided by, an interpreter."" (135) 
- He says ""all approaches seek to ground the symbols through the sensorimotor capacities of the artificial agents involved. The strategies differ in the methods used to elaborate the data obtained from the sensorimotor experiences, and in the role (if any) assigned to the elaboration of the data representations ... [but] none of the strategies can be said to offer a *valid* solution to the SGP. We shall see that this does not mean that they are theoretically flawed or uninteresting, nor that they cannot work, when technically implemented. The conclusion is rather that, conceptually, insofar as they seem successful, such strategies either fail to address the SGP or circumvent it, by implicitly presupposing its solution and begging the question."" (135)

6.2 THE SYMBOL GROUNDING PROBLEM

- The challenge posed by the SGP is:
	a) No form of innatism is allowed; no semantic resources can magically be presupposed as being pre-installed in the artificial agent (AA)
	b) No form of externalism is allowed; no semantic resources should be uploaded from the 'outside' by some *deus ex machina* already semantically proficient
	c) The AA may have its own capacities and resources to be able to ground its symbols.
- These three conditions are hereafter referred to as the Zero-semantic commitment condition (Z-condition).
- ""These three conditions only exclude the possibility that such resources may be semantic in the first place"" (137).

6.3 THE REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- This approach ""considers the conceptual and categorical representations, elaborated by an AA as the meanings of the symbols used by that AA. The problem is that ""the available representations---whether categorical or perceptual---succeed in grounding the symbols used by an AA only at the price of begging the question. We shall see that their elaboration, and hence availability, presuppose precisely those semantic capacities or resources that the approach is trying to show to be autonomously evolvable by an AA in the first place."" (138) 
- Harnad's (1990) hybrid model is examined first. If an AA using the hybrid model, which he calls 'Perc', uses say, neural networks to take in perceptual data and create conceptual categories such as 'quadruped animal', the conceptual categories could be considered the meanings of Perc's symbols. But Floridi notes that if the neural network uses supervised learning, it requires an external source of labeled training data and violates part (b) of the Z-condition. If the neural net is unsupervised, then the networks ""still need to have *built-in biases* and feature-detectors in order to reach the desired output. ... Moreover, unsupervised or self-organizing networks, once they have been trained, still need to have their output checked to see whether the obtained structures make any sense with respect to the input data space. This difficult process of validation is carried out externally by a supervisor [which is] entirely *extrinsic*."" **See note 1 in the discussion section below for my take on this.**
- What about an approach that constructs categories automatically given similarities between data? Floridi likens this to a move made by Berkeley in criticism of Locke, and says it still fails: ""how is the class of horses (the data space) put together in the first place, without any semantic capacity to elaborate the general idea ... of 'horse' to begin with? And how is a particular specimen of horse privileged over all the others as being the particular horse that could represent all the others, without presupposing some semantic capacities? And finally, how does one know that what makes that representation of a particular horse the representation of a universal horse is not, for example, the whiteness instead of the four-legged nature of the represented horse?""
- Another representationalist approach is that of Mayo (2003), whose *functional model* of AA shows that AAs can elaborate concepts ""in such a way as to be able to ground even abstract names."" Because data always underdetermine their structure, categories are interpreted as ""task-specific sets that collect representations according to their practical function. Symbols are formed in order to solve specific task-oriented problems in particular environments."" For example, ""an AA can generalize the meaning of the symbol 'victory' if, according to Mayo, 'victory' is not rigidly connected to a specific occurrence of a single event but derives its meaning from the representation of the intersection of all the occurrences of 'victory' in different task-specific sets of various events, such as 'victory' in chess, in tennis, [etc]"".
- Floridi claims that Mayo (2003) still fails the Z-condition because it relies on initial representations (Mayo's ""functional criteria"") which the AA already has access to---thus violating part (a) of the Z-condition.
- Sun (2000) proposes an intentional model which builds on a Heideggerian dichotomy of being-in-the-world and being-with-the-world. ""According to Sun, representations do not stand for the corresponding perceived objects, but rather for the uses that an AA can make of these objects as means to ends."" Sun has a first/bottom level of learning, and a second/top level of learning, with qualitatively different processing mechanisms and knowledge sets, which complement each other.
- But again, Floridi claims, the Z condition is breached already because Sun's approach has ""innate biases or built-in constraints and predispositions which also depend on the (ontogenetic and phylogenetic) history of agent world interaction"".
- Sun's model, called CLARION, employs Q-learning (which is based on reinforcement learning) **(See note 2)**. Floridi notes ""the algorithm works only if the (solution of the) problem can be modelled and executed in a finite time ... it is already clear that, by adopting the Q-learning algorithm, the intentional model is importing from the outside the very condition that allows CLARION to semanticize, since tasks, goals, success, [etc.] are all established by the programmer.""

6.4 THE SEMI-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Semi-representationalist approaches are also representationalist in nature, but deal with the AA's use of its representations by ""replying on principles imported from behaviour-based robotics.""
- Davidsson (1993) says that a description has three parts:
	1) designator - the name (symbol) used to refer to a category;
	2) epistemological representation - used to recognize instances of a category;
	3) inferential representation - a collection of all that is known about a category and its members and can be used to make predictions or infer non-perceptual information.
- Davidsson discusses two paradigms of machine learning: learning by observation (basically unsupervised learning, which Floridi says relies on a programmer to provide ""well-selected description entities""), and learning from examples (which Floridi says not only requires a trainer to select examples to learn from, but also ""presupposes a set of explicitly pre-classified (by the human teacher) examples of the categories to be acquired."" Thus Davidsson's strategy fails.
- Rosenstein and Cohen (1998) try to use a bottom-up process (perception -> symbolic thought), by using a ""method of delays"" allowing the AA to store perceptual data as-is (thus avoiding external semantic committments), a predictive semantics, and an unsupervised learning process which elaborates the semantics. It plots data on a cartesian coordinate system, thus constructing a ""cartesian representation"". But ""this 'Cartesian' semantic framework is entirely extraneous to the AA, either being presumed to be there (innatism) or, more realistically, having been superimposed by the programmer. ... the very interpretation of the data, provided by the actions, as information of such and such a kind of Cartesian coordinate system is, by itself, a crucial semantic step, based on extrinsic criteria.""

6.5 THE NON-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Non-representationalist approaches do not have symbolic representations (at least not in the localist, explicit sense), but for such approaches ""the SGP is merely postponed rather than avoided. ... [I]f it is to develop even an elementary protolanguage and some higher cognitive capacities, it will have to manipulate some symbols, but then the question of their semantic grounding presents itself anew."" **See note 3 below**.
- Floridi recalls the classic papers by Brooks (Brooks 1990,1991) on embodied/situated cognition.
- In his criticism of Billard and Dautenhahn (1999)'s DRAMA system, he notes that it has ""a reliance on neural networks, which incurs the same problems highlighted in section 6.3.1"". **(see note 4 below)**.

CONCLUSION

- ""(the semantic capacity to generate) representations cannot be presupposed without begging the question. Yet abandoning any reference to representations means accepting a dramatic limit to what an AA may be able to achieve semantically"". Instead Floridi introduces seven features that a valid solution to the SGP will need to combine:
1. a bottom-up, sensorimotor approach to the grounding problem;
2. a top-down feedback approach that allows the harmonization of top-level grounded symbols and bottom-level, sensorimotor interactions with the environment;
3. the availability of some sort of representational capacities in the AA;
4. the availability of some sort of categorical/abstracting capacities in the AA;
5. the availability of some sort of communication capacities among AAs in order to ground the symbols diachronically and avoid the Wittgensteinian problem of a 'private language';
6. an evolutionary approach in the development of 1-5;
7. the satisfaction of the Z condition in the development of 1-6."" (161)




DISCUSSION TOPICS

**Note 1** I've seen similar criticisms of solutions to the SGP before where the ""biases"" of some learning algorithm were taken to be signs of the programmer putting semantic information into the system and thus violating the SGP. But this is entirely too nit-picky in my opinion. *Of course* there are biases in any learning algorithm; real-life brains have biases that follow from their constructions: the minimum/maximum firing rate of human neurons, the biologically-determined connectivity between certain parts of the brain, etc. If I created a computer simulation to exactly model the human brain down to the neurobiological level, then nobody could reasonably accuse me of imparting semantic information into that simulation, would they?
And Floridi's statement that unsupervised networks need to have their output checked and therefore they violate the Z-condition is problematic---sparse autoencoders, for example, can learn representations given low-level data by performing their own checks, on their own generated representations. Yes, those checks are subjected to a mathematical error metric that is encoded by a human, but once the formula is encoded once it never has to be changed no matter how many representations are generated---more akin to the constraints set by the physical properties of the brain and neurons themselves!

**Note 2** Ron Sun's solution is classified as representationalist, and then closes the chapter with seven features which presumably he believes are not met with Sun's CLARION architecture. I am extremely familiar with Ron Sun's work; in fact I have published papers with him in the past, and I can tell you this: The majority of Floridi's criticisms in this chapter are based on a 10-year-old misunderstanding of what CLARION can and does do (which is 1-6, and likely 7). 

**Note 3** Does the symbol grounding problem still apply when dealing with representations that use symbols which are not declarative knowledge (knowledge *that*), but rather procedural knowledge (knowledge of *how*)? In the human brain, neurons can be said to have a symbolic state (either firing or not firing) *at a certain level of description*, but this level of description is not explicitly used by the human agent, rather the human behaves *in accordance with* behaviors whose state is set by the states of the neurons. This is quite different than behaving *because* some symbolic reasoning took place.

**Note 4** Now Floridi seems to be treating the use of neural networks as if he has performed a mathematical proof-style reduction to a previously solved problem: simply having a neural network now is sufficient to declare that the system violates the Z-condition? This case is not quite made (see my mention of sparse autoencoder networks). Am I missing something?"
"Objection to a Premise in Dennett's Theory of MindIn his reply to Searle’s *The Myth of the Computer*, Daniel Dennett writes the following on categorizing objects exclusively on their “causal powers” (Dennett expresses similar ideas in his book *The Intentional Stance*):

>Surely we all agree that anything that has all the relevant causal powers of food—it saves one from starving, sustains growth and repair, tastes good, etc.—*is* food. And anything that has all the causal powers of oxygen is oxygen. We think that you could in principle give a body an artificial brain by giving it something that duplicated *all* the brain’s *control* powers. And any creature so equipped would “have a mind” in the only sense that makes any sense: it would have a well-functioning (prosthetic) brain.

http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1982/06/24/the-myth-of-the-computer-an-exchange/

I believe that the idea that “anything that has all the causal powers of oxygen is oxygen” does not hold if we replace “oxygen” with “a conscious mind.”   The reason for this is that there is more to the identity and categorization of minds then simply outputs and causal powers. 


Note:  In the above quote, Dennett uses the term “causal power” because it is the term that Searle used in his reply.  Dennett seems to prefer the term “control powers” and so I will use that in the thought experiment below.  In context it is meant as the actions of the brain & behaviors of people. 


To highlight the significance of considering qualia on the identity of minds, consider the following thought experiment.   Suppose sometime in the future that AI programs become so sophisticated that not only can they pass the Turing test, but we can map a given individual’s brain and replicate their actions so effectively that even people that know the individual cannot distinguish between the AI and the person.  Let’s assume that robotics is also sufficiently advanced to the point that we can construct a robot that is indistinguishable from the human body and that we can put a computer running these AI programs into robots and match all of the actions and behaviors of humans.  


Now let’s assume you have been in a happy marriage for many years and have many shared experiences with your spouse.  We take your spouse and map their brain and body and build a robot/cyborg replica that is able to match the control powers of their brain and physically are indistinguishable from your spouse.  The robot even would have the memories of your spouse in its memory.  This replica is so effective at producing the responses and reactions of your spouse that you are not able to distinguish between your spouse and the robot.  Even though their external outputs are the same, would you consider the robotic replica, which matches the actions and behaviors of your spouse, as equivalent to your spouse?  Would you consider your spouse and the robot as interchangeable?  If not, then there must be something besides control powers of the brain that is significant to the identity and categorization of minds.   I posit that what is important to the identity to conscious beings is the internal subjective experience (i.e. qualia) had by the conscious individual.  For example, if your spouse died and the robot replica took their place, the fact that the entity that has the subjective experience that you identify as your spouse was not actually sharing the experiences with you would make all the difference to you.   


We could also take the thought experiment a step further and consider the case in which you yourself are mapped and replicated with a robot with an AI brain. Its causal powers would be interchangeable with your own to the point where the rest of the world could not tell you from your robotic replica.  Would you experience the same qualia or subjective experience as the replica?  If you had a conversation with your replica, would you see it through both pairs of eyes?  If not, then we can conclude that it is not you.


At this point an objection may be raised that even though we cannot identify a given individual solely by the control powers of the brain, we can identify properties or categories of objects based on behaviors or control/causal powers.  Therefore, we can also identify consciousness as a general property of objects or entities based on behaviors.   To illustrate, we can carry this argument over to non-conscious objects.  For example, let’ say we define a kitchen knife as an object that has a sharpened metal blade, a handle, and can effectively cut food.  Now we may not be able to replace my particular kitchen knife by building a replica, but we can easily produce an object that is a kitchen knife (i.e. has the property of being a kitchen knife and belongs in the category of kitchen knives) and matches all the causal powers of some particular kitchen knife (even though the specific identities of each are different).  


However, a fundamental characteristic of conscious beings is that we consider their internal perspective and experience and not merely what they do or are capable of doing.  It is important for to us to know what is going on in the minds of others regardless of how they behave.   We learn from an early age that people’s behaviors and their internal thoughts are in two distinct categories.  In adult relationships, the internal experience of others is just as important to us as how they behave.  In short, behaviors are consequences or outputs of conscious beings, but it is not consciousness itself.  Defining consciousness based on behaviors (i.e. the control powers of the brain) alone is not correct.  It is reasonable to assume that over time we will get better and better at replicating the outputs and behaviors of humans with AI.  But even if we get to the point where we are able to match the behavior of humans perfectly, this doesn’t necessarily mean we have produced internal subjective experience or qualia.

"Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution.Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution. **[This was written BEFORE the Occupy movement began]**


February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"Thought experiment: The simulated manI realize this may not be terribly original but this thought experiment helped me think about determinism and free will so I thought I'd share.

I read about some scientists who created an [atomic-level simulation of a virus](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Publications/Papers/paper.cgi?tbcode=FRED2006) in order to better study it's properties. Apparently this is reasonably straightforward as the laws of physics are well enough understood that the model's behavior doesn't appreciably differ from the real virus.

Wouldn't it be interesting if we could create an atomic-scale simulation of a person? This person would exist in a completely deterministic universe (the computer) so there wouldn't be any doubt about whether or not determinism was in play. Do we expect such a simulated person to differ substantially in behavior from a real person? My intuition says no, but apparently lots of people think such a simulated person would somehow lack free will.

(I suppose you could complain that you could never create such a simulation of a real person since you could never know precisely how the atoms were configured. I don't think that would be a problem however. You could just start with a single fertilized egg which - after all, is only one cell - and simulate it through to adulthood.)"
"AMA Announcement: Monday 1/8 1PM EST - Hilary Lawson, Director of the Institute of Art and Ideas, Founder of the HowTheLightGetsIn philosophy on post-realist philosophy and public philosophyThe mods of /r/philosophy are pleased to announce an upcoming AMA by Hilary Lawson, Director of the Institute of Art and Ideas, Founder of the HowTheLightGetsIn philosophy festival and Vice Chair of the LSE Forum for European Philosophy.

Hilary Lawson will be joining us on Monday January 8th at 1PM EST to discuss issues in post-realist philosophy, metaphysics and his work with public philosophy. Hear it from him:

**Hilary Lawson**

Hi reddit, I'm Hilary Lawson - post-realist philosopher, director of
the Institute of Art and Ideas and founder of the world's largest
philosophy and music festival [HowTheLightGetsIn](https://hay.htlgi.iai.tv/utmsource=HLAMA).

Born and raised  in Bristol, England, I was awarded a scholarship to study
PPE at Balliol College Oxford . As a post-graduate I came to see paradoxes
of self-reference as the central philosophical issue and began a DPhil on
The Reflexivity of Discourse. This later became the basis for my first
philosophical book *Reflexivity: The Post-Modern Predicament*.

Alongside my more philosophical writing, I also pursued a media career
following my studies. Within a few years I had created my own prime time
television series 'Where There's Life' with a weekly UK audience in excess
of ten million. In 1982, I went on to co-author a book based on the series
and  was appointed Editor of Programmes and later Deputy Chief Executive
at the television station TV-am.

Meanwhile I continued to develop my philosophical thinking and had initial
sketches of the theory later to become Closure. In 1985 I wrote
*Reflexivity: The Post-Modern Predicament* as part of a series on modern
European thought. In the book, I argued that the paradoxes of
self-reference are central to philosophy and drive the writings of
Nietzsche, Heidegger and Derrida.

In the late 1980s I founded the production company TVF Media which made
documentary and current affairs programming, including Channel 4's
flagship international current affairs programme, The World This Week. I
was editor of the programme, which ran weekly between 1987 and 1991. The
programme predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall, the war in Yugoslavia and
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, amongst its other laudable achievements.

In the 1990s, I focused on writing [*Closure*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Closure-Story-Everything-Hilary-Lawson/dp/0415136504). It took a decade to complete
and was published in 2001. The book has been described as the first
non-realist metaphysics. Having begun my philosophical career as a
proponent of postmodernism, latterly I became a critic arguing for the
necessity of an overall framework and the need to move on from a focus on
language.

Closure proposes that the human condition is to find ourselves on the cusp
of openness and closure. The world is open and we, along with other living
organisms, are able to apprehend and make sense of it through the process
of closure. I would define closure as the holding of that which is
different as one and the same. Human experience is seen to be the result
of successive layers of closure, which I consider to be preliminary,
sensory and inter-sensory closure. The highest level of closure,
inter-sensory closure realises language and thought. The theory shifts the
focus of philosophy away from language and towards an exploration of the
relationship between openness and closure. An important element of the
theory of closure is its own self-referential character.

I founded the [Institute of Art and Ideas](https://iai.tv/) in 2008 with the aim of making
ideas and philosophy a central part of cultural life. Our website IAI.tv,
which posts to the sub, was launched in 2011. We then moved to publishing
articles in 2013 and free philosophy courses on [IAI Academy](https://iai.tv/iai-academy/courses) in 2014.

Please feel free to post questions for Hilary Lawson here. He will look at this thread before he starts and begin with some questions from here while the initial questions in the new thread come in.

Please join us in welcoming Hilary Lawson to our community!

"
"The Meaning Of Life: My Analysis And ThoughtsThis is a question that has been asked since humans first became  conscious intelligent beings. It is arguably the most powerful question  in philosophy, and the one that is most often associated with it. There  have been many different answers to this question throughout history.  Different philosophers, scientists and historians have all attempted to  give their unique spin to the question “what is the meaning of life?”.  In today’s post, I am going to examine some of these ideas, break down  the question into smaller pieces, and articulate my own response to this  philosophical inquiry.

**Before we begin this journey, we must first define two important and relevant terms; the concepts “life” and “meaning”.**  

Let’s first look at three definitions for the word “life”:

1. The condition that distinguishes animals and plants  from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,  functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2. The existence of an individual human being or animal.
3. The period between the birth and death of a living thing, especially a human being.

Let’s now look at three definitions for the word “meaning”:

1. What is meant by a concept?
2. What is the significance of a concept?
3. What is the important or worthwhile quality of a concept?

**Now that we have defined both concepts, let’s break things down even further.**

When we are asking “what is the meaning of life?”, we are essentially asking the following 3 questions:

1. What is life?
2. What is life’s significance?
3. How does one live life in the best possible manner?

After having answered these questions, we will be able to synthesize  all of our ideas and create a response to the question that is the  subject of this article.

**What is life?**

As mentioned earlier, life is the condition that distinguishes  animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for  growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change  preceding death.

**Let’s dive deeper into some of these properties.**

1. Organization. Living things are highly organized,  meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living  organisms are made up of one or more cells, which are considered the  fundamental units of life.
2. Metabolism. Living things must use  energy and consume nutrients to carry out the chemical reactions that  sustain life, such as growing, reproducing and maintain the structure of  their bodies.
3. Homeostasis. The maintenance of a stable internal  environment, even in the face of a changing external environment, is  known as homeostasis.
4. Growth. Living organisms undergo regulated growth.
5. Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce themselves to create new organisms.
6. Response: Living organisms show “irritability,” meaning that they respond to stimuli or changes in their environment.
7. Evolution:  Populations of living organisms can undergo evolution, meaning that the  genetic makeup of a population may change over time.

While understanding this list of properties will not greatly affect  our day-to-day framework of how we think and live our lives, it is still  important to know the difference between a living organism and  non-living entity.

**The next question one might have is, how did life begin?**

Many scientists believe that chemical reactions led to RNA, which was  the first molecule on Earth to self-replicate and begin the process of  evolution that led to more advanced forms of life, including human  beings.

**Now that we know how life began in general, let’s examine how life began for human beings.**

Humans evolved from a species known as Homo erectus. Furthermore,  humans share a common ancestor with chimpanzees. For most of our species  history, we were not the dominant force we are today; we were somewhere  in the middle of the animal food chain. Everything changed during the  cognitive revolution that occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago.

We discovered fire, created tools, and developed language. The most  important thing we did was create and connect around ideas that do not  physically exist, such as religion, politics and capitalism. This level  of imagination and consciousness is something that no other living  entity possesses. It is thanks to the cognitive revolution that we are  the dominant, intelligent and conscious beings that we know ourselves to  be today, and it is thanks to our consciousness that we are able to ask  questions such as “what is the meaning of life?”.

**Another big question that we have is the question of how the Universe started.**

The Big Bang theory is the most commonly accepted response to this.

* The Big Band theory is the prevailing cosmological model  explaining the existence of the observable universe form the earliest  known period through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model  describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high  density and temperature.

In recent years, another theory called String theory has gotten quite popular.

* In String theory, the multiverse is a hypothetical group of  multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that  exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and  the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different  universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”, “other  universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”.

We now understand what characteristics separate living organisms from  inorganic matter, how life began, how humans evolved, and why humans  are different from other living organisms. Furthermore, we are able to  somewhat understand what the Universe is and how it started.

**However, we are still left with many questions.**

Are we special? Are we the only intelligent and conscious entities in  the universe or in the multiverse? Is anything “real”, or are we living  in a simulation? Does God exist? Is there life after death? How do all  of the complexities of the Universe work? Is there a deeper purpose to  life or are we merely just bodies of carbon living in a world that is  random and that does not care about us?

Unfortunately, these questions have no objective answers to them. The  deeper we dig, the more questions we have. Science can only answer so  much. There is only so much we can understand about life, about  existence and about the Universe. String theory says that there are 11  dimensions. Humans are only equipped to experience and understand 4 of  those dimensions. With that being said, the progress that we have made  in the last few hundred years has been remarkable. With every year that  passes, we understand a little bit more about the Universe and about  ourselves.

We are curious beings and we are wired to want to explore, to ask  questions, and to try to find answers to the mysteries of the world.

**What is life’s significance?**

As mentioned, we will never know whether we are merely just bodies of  carbon living in a vast apathetic and random Universe, or whether there  is a deeper purpose to our lives and to our existence. With that being  said, life is still meaningful and significant, and the best way to  figure how is to analyze how we are wired as human beings.

Similar to how machines and robots are wired to think and behave in  certain ways, human beings are wired to want and desire certain things.  If there is one thing I want to emphasize in this section, it’s that  while technology and culture have progressed drastically over the last  100 years, we still have the same desires that we had thousands of years  ago and we have not changed much biologically over that time span. The  only difference between today and two thousand years ago is that we are  now satisfying our desires and needs in newer and more complex ways.

**Physical survival.**

Survival is the deepest and most important instinct that we have. As  mentioned earlier in this article, for most of our specie’s history we  were somewhere in the middle of the animal food chain. Without good  health and a good environment, life is difficult and filled with  suffering. No baby is born ready to give up and commit suicide. It takes  a process full of corruption and suffering for a human being to get to  that point. Humans and animals are wired to want to live. As Abraham  Maslow points out in his hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety  needs are the foundation of his pyramid.

While physical survival used to be the act of running from a tiger or  getting shelter in a cave, physical survival today in the western world  is eating healthy, making money, investing, going to the gym, attaining  influence and power, sleeping well, etc.

**Reproduction.**

Reproduction is survival in a different form; survival of our genes  and of our specie. We are wired to want to procreate. Evolution made the  act of sex enjoyable. Our desire for reproduction has not changed.  What’s changed is that as a result of newer technologies, safety and  security, and world dominance, people realize that taking care of  children is a time-consuming lifestyle and choose to focus on their  other needs and goals first, keeping their desire for children as  something to explore later in their lives. Thanks to technological  advancements such as birth control and abortion, people have more  control over their lives and are able to enjoy the benefits of sex  without its consequences.

**Belongingness and Love.**

Humans beings are social animals. We are not meant to live in  isolation. In large part, the way we learn, understand ourselves and the  world, maintain our health and sanity, and think about and solve  problems is by communicating and cooperating with others. There is a  concept that is known as Dunbar’s number. It is essentially a claim that  humans can maintain no more than 150 friendships and connections at a  time. Yuval Noah Harari’s talks about this in detail in his book  “Sapiens”.

Yuval went on to explain that the reason we are able to cooperate in  large groups and dominate the world despite our cognitive limit to the  number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships,  is because of our ability to connect around shares beliefs, such as  stoicism, Christianity, capitalism, money, etc. This shows just how  important connecting with others is for us. In fact, our ability to  communicate and connect with others is one of the biggest reasons how we  went from being in the middle of the animal food chain to the civilized  and dominant people we are today.  

In connection with this desire to connect with others, we are also  wired to want to love and to be loved. Love is crucial for a child’s development. Without adequate love at  an early age during sensitive and critical periods, children develop  attachment issues that can affect them for the rest of their lives. This  shows just how crucial love is for us. Even when we grow up and become  teenagers and adults, we are still yearning for belongingness and love.  It might be something as simple as having anxiety in high school because  we don’t feel as though we have good friends. It might be the  experience of being depressed because a close family member passed away  and we regret not having told them how much we love them. It might be  throwing a fun surprise birthday party for a best friend or sibling  because of how much we cherish them.

Our desire and need to love and to be loved shows itself in numerous  ways throughout our lives. Christopher McCandless wrote this before his  death, “Happiness only real when shared”. This was coming from a man who  had escaped humanity his whole life and who lived his final days in  isolation in the wilderness. Despite pushing people away his entire  life, McCandless realized moments before his death that our lives are  meaningless if we are not surrounded by loved ones.

Another important form of love is self-love. At the end of day, the  only person that will be there with us at every moment of our lives is  ourselves. It is therefore crucial to have a good relationship with  ourselves. If we can’t love ourselves then how can we expect others to  love us? Ayn Rand put this idea beautifully with this quote, “To say ‘I  love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.”

**Curiosity.**

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Europe with  three ships. The explorer and navigator who completed four voyages  across the Atlantic Ocean is known today as one of the most important  figures in history, opening the way for widespread European exploration  and the colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first  European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Christopher Columbus, as well as the thousands of others throughout  history who put their lives at risk for the sake of curiosity and  exploration, did so because they did not want humanity to be forever  bounded by geography and ignorance. The Apollo Lunar Module Eagle  landing on the moon on July 20, 1969 is another example of humankind  attempting to expend its horizons. History is filled with pioneers and  giants from all fields; people like Socrates, Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da  Vinci, Martin Luther King Jr, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,  etc.

Going out of our comfort zones, taking risks, being creative,  expending our horizons, being curious, asking questions, trying new  things, and exploring the earth and space is something that is deeply  ingrained in us. Our desire to explore and to be curious is something  that sets us apart from all other living organisms; it’s what makes us  unique.

Curiosity doesn’t always have to lead to world-changing events like  stepping on the moon or discovering America. Sometimes, curiosity can be  something as simple as sitting down and writing a paper on a topic we  find interesting. Curiosity can be the experience of taking a vacation  and visiting countries and cultures we have never seen. Curiosity can be  the decision to indulge in good habits and to stick to them despite the  discomfort they may cause at first. Curiosity can be the process of  starting a business on an idea we are passionate about. Curiosity is all  around us, and it is one of the most primal instincts that we have.  Let’s embrace our curiosity and our desire for exploration, and let’s  create lives that we will be proud of.  

**Legacy.**

As mentioned earlier, one of the instincts that motivates us the  instinct for survival. We have already talked about two forms of  survival in this article; physical survival and the survival of our  genes and of our specie. There is a third form of survival that controls  much of what we do in life; spiritual survival. Immortality is a desire  that is primal to us. We have the gift of consciousness, but also its  curse. We are the only living organism that is able to imagine and think  about its own death. We don’t want to die. It’s in our nature to desire  survival. For that reason, we try to stay healthy and to physically  survive for as long as can.

However, physical survival is often not enough. We understand  consciously that there will come a time when our bodies will no longer  be able to function. We understand that we will physically die one day.  For that reason, some people turn to religion and God and believe that  if they live a life following certain commandments and behaving in  certain ways, then they will go to heaven and live for eternity. Others  understand that the afterlife is something that we don’t fully  understand. Is there an afterlife? What happens after death? Despite  physical death, will our spirits and souls live on?

These are all pertinent questions. I have the view that there are  certain things that we can’t control. We can’t control what happens to  us after we die. We can control, however, what we do in this life. We  are not guaranteed the promise of heaven. For that reason, we must turn  our attention to building the best legacy we can. Perhaps our name will  be able to live on for generations. Perhaps the value that we will have  given to humankind will play a role in immortalizing our spirit. Perhaps  the legacy we desire is what we leave behind to our children, to our  family, and to our loved ones.

There is a reason that we still remember the names of some of  history’s greatest and most ambitious. There is a reason we still  remember Socrates, his Socratic method of questioning and the honor he  showed in the face of death. There is a reason we still remember Julius  Caesar, the empire he built, and how his empire played a large role in  the development of modern government. There is a reason we remember  Galileo, why we call him the father of observational astronomy, why we  call him the father of the scientific method, and how he stood up for  his beliefs and was a contrarian at a time when going against the grain  could get one killed. There is a reason we will remember Elon Musk long  after he is dead, and his contributions to electric vehicles, space  travel, and clean energy.

The desire for legacy is a great one; there is a lot of meaning that  can be found in its pursuit. The desire for prestige, for  accomplishment, for competition, and for status are some of the most  primal desires that we have. Abraham Maslow, the prominent psychologist  includes esteem needs and self-actualisation as part of his hierarchy of  needs.

It’s important to understand that only a few will be able to have  their names and work immortalized for centuries. Let’s not let that  derail us. It is not the final product that counts. It is the process of  working on something that is greater than ourselves that is of  paramount significance here. In order to build a great legacy, it is  important to help others, to provide value, and to try to push humanity  forward.

Some people will argue that the desire to work towards a great legacy  is stupid. They will argue that one day humans will go extinct and that  when this happens, nobody will know Galileo, Napoleon, Einstein, or  whoever else we want to name. This is a strong logical argument. The  reason I disagree with this view, however, is that logic is not always  the most important factor in an argument. If there’s one thing I want to  make clear in this article, it’s the important of meaning and of  purpose. Where is the meaning in nihilism? Where is the purpose in  believing that we are insignificant and that our lives will mean nothing  millions of years from now?

Despite the fact that these statements may both be logically correct,  what we are trying to articulate in this article is a framework that  will be helpful in our day-to-day lives. A desire for legacy is not only  deeply wired in us, but it is also honorable to want to better  ourselves and to want to better the world. It is honorable to want to  leave behind a piece of who we are, whether in the form of family, in  the form writing, in the form of art, in the form of inventions, in the  form of exploration, or in whatever other medium we choose.

**Acquiring knowledge and transferring it to future generations.**  

If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s the importance of  protecting our species’ knowledge and successfully transferring it  across generations. This goes back to our desire for survival, and more  specifically our desire for the survival of our species. If we do not  safeguard our knowledge, then how can we make sure that the human  species will progress? How can we make sure that we will learn from  history and not commit mistakes that we have committed in the past? We  can’t. It is why books have always been valuable.

Walking in a library is one of the most surreal things that one can  experience. In a library, we have the ability to read from the greatest  minds of human history; Plato, Aristotle, Albert Einstein, Stephen  Hawking, Will Durant, etc. We have more books and more wisdom than can  last a lifetime. Furthermore, our brain is a muscle and it must be  trained. If we spend our days mindlessly scrolling social media and not  putting our brain to use, then we will develop mental problems later in  life and we will not have fulfilled even an ounce of the potential that  we have.

It is our duty to acquire knowledge, to learn as much as we can, and  to put this knowledge into practice. Despite having books and wisdom  from some of the greatest thinkers of all time, our world and our  societies still face many problems. Every era has its own unique set of  problems, and it is our responsibility to learn as much as we can and to  turn our knowledge into practical action. Furthermore, it is our  responsibility transfer our species’ and our personal knowledge to our  kids and future generations so that they will be well equipped to deal  with the challenges of their time.

**Well-being.**

If there is one thing that almost all religions, philosophies, and  schools of thought have in common, it’s that they aim to reduce  suffering and increase well-being.

* Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and  prosperity. It includes having good mental health, high life  satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to manage  stress.

The desires to reduce stress, and to experience happiness and  prosperity are fundamental to who we are. Throughout much of our  species’ history, we experienced wars, diseases, natural catastrophes,  etc. Christopher Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author  wrote the following, “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely  at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history”. This  is a fascinating statistic.

As mentioned earlier, our desires for competition and status, and our  instinct to separate into groups are all part of what makes us human.  Despite all the good that has come from those desires, there has also  been a lot of suffering that has resulted from them. The world can  sometimes be a cruel place filled with evil. It is for this reason that  so many religions and philosophies have attempting to figure out ways in  which we can reduce suffering.

A large part of well-being has to do with health. Gut health, for  example, is strongly correlated with mental health. It is for this  reason that people who have gut problems suffer in life satisfaction. To  be happy, healthy, and to prosper are goals that everyone has. A big  part of making progress towards those goals is combining a lot of the  things that have already talked about in prior sections of this article.  Are we living healthy lives? Are we constantly trying to learn more and  expend our horizons? Do we feel loved and are we surrounded by people  who cherish us? Are we working on our legacies and on projects that  excite us, or are we wasting our time and potential?

Happiness is not something that should be chased. The more we chase  happiness, the more miserable we will be. There is a great book about  this topic called “The Language of Emotions”. It’s important for us to  understand that all emotions are equally important, and that each  emotion serves its own unique purpose. Anger, for example, allows us to  create boundaries. Sadness allows us to release energy. Fear lets us  know when we are in danger. We need to allow happiness to come as a  by-product of a life well-lived, and when it does come, we need let it  be free like a bird; it will come and go when it pleases.

Contentment is a far better thing to aim for. When we are content, we  are grateful for everything that we have. With that being said, we  still try to get a little bit better every day. Mindfulness is also  important. In today’s world of over-stimulation, instant gratification,  and constant comparison, it is easy for us to spend much of our time  either stressing about the future or being depressed about the past.  It’s important to take a step back, to be grateful, and to ask ourselves  what we can do today to better our lives and to create good habits.

Finally, we need to understand that well-being is something that is  unique to each of us. What motivates me and makes me happy, might be  different than what motivates you and makes you happy. It is our  responsibility to have self-awareness, to understand ourselves, and to  understand what drives us.

**How does one live life in the best possible manner?**

Let’s look at what some famous thinkers, philosophies, religions, and schools of thought have said about this.

**Stoicism.**

* Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in  Athens in the early 3rd c entury BC. It is a philosophy of personal  ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural  world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to meaning  and happiness is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,  by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or  by the fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to  do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating  others fairly and justly.

Stoicism was the primary philosophy during the time of the Roman  Empire. The beautiful thing about Stoicism is that arguably the two most  famous Stoics in history came from completely opposing situations and  classes; Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a man who was born  a slave. Despite their complete opposing life situations, both Marcus  Aurelius and Epictetus wrote and talked about all of the same Stoic  virtues. In recent years, Stoicism has had a resurgence. Marcus  Aurelius’ journal “Meditations” is now one of the most famous books in  the world. Furthermore, books from modern writers such as Ryan Holiday  have brought Stoicism into the mainstream.

**Existentialism.**

* Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores  the problem of human existence and centers on the lived experience of  the thinking, feeling, acting individual. In the view of the  existentialist, the individual’s starting point has been called “the  existential angst,” a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or  anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.  Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the  meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were some of the first and most important existentialists.

* Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is  that existence precedes essence, which means that individuals shape  themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived  categories, an “essence”. The actual life of the individuals is what  constitutes what could be called their “true essence” instead of an  arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings,  through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a  meaning to their life.

**Epicureanism.**

* Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BC  based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.  Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable  pleasure in the form of tranquility and freedom from fear, and the  absence of bodily pain through knowledge of the workings of the world  and limiting desires.
* Epicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life.  Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest  amount of pleasure possible during one’s lifetime yet doing so  moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in  such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than  on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially  produced desires were to be suppressed.

**Objectivism.**

* Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by  Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in  her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged  (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books. Rand described  Objectivism as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own  happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement  as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”.

I read a large portion of the book “The Fountainhead” about a year  ago and I enjoyed it. This is one of the passages that has stuck with  me.

* “It is not in the nature of man–nor of any living entity–to start out by  giving up, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that  requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man.  Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run  down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or  how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their  elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning  one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’s values; practicality, of  losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that  fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and  reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek  a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.”

The reason I like this passage so much is because it communicates in  very clear and poetic terms the idea that a desire for meaning and that a  desire for improvement and greatness are core elements of who we are.

**Logotherapy.**

* Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor  Frankl. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the  belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most  powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to  this system is given in Frankl’s most famous book, Man’s Search for  Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his  Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and  reinforced his theories.
* According to Frankl, “We can discover this meaning in life in  three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by  experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude  we take toward unavoidable suffering” and that “everything can be taken  from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose  one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.

**My Thoughts.**

As can be seen, there exists many great schools of thoughts and  philosophies. What almost all of them have in common is the emphasis  they place on pursuing meaning. We live in a world filled with instant  gratification, overstimulation, misinformation, censorship, anxiety and  fearmongering. Furthermore, we live in a world and in an environment  that pedestalizes short-term harmful pleasure and makes it difficult to  delay gratification and pursue meaningful projects and activities. It is  our duty as individuals to take responsibility for our lives, to work  to better ourselves in incremental fashion, to work to better the world,  to try to enjoy the process of life, to love ourselves, and to pursue  meaning rather than short-term detrimental pleasure.

As mentioned earlier in his article, the are many existential and  philosophical questions that we are not able to answer. Perhaps with the  advancement of science we will one day be able to better comprehend the  complexities of the Universe. However, for the time being, we must  focus on what we can control as individuals and create frameworks for  thinking and living that are helpful for our development.

I believe that a large part of the meaning of life is to live  according to our instincts; maintaining good health, being surrounded by  people we love, working on our legacies, acquiring knowledge,  transferring our knowledge across generations, procreating, and placing  great importance on our well-being. However, it’s important to also  understand that we are not chained by our instincts. Each of us have  something special in us that gives us the ability to think and to be  creative. This ability to be flexible, to explore, to try new things, to  learn from great thinkers and philosophers, to go outside of our  comfort zones, to take risk, to go against the grain, to be contrarians,  to be creative, to think outside the box, and to constantly ask  questions and find solutions is what makes us special.

Going back to Viktor Frankl, one of my favorite quotes is the  following, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that  space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our  growth and our freedom.”

I want to emphasize once more that there is meaning in life and that  this meaning can be found all around us. We sometimes see people who  have fallen into nihilism. As someone who once fell into nihilism,  perhaps I can shed some light on my experience and on why nihilism can  be appealing.

* Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that  nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with  extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

The reason I fell into nihilism was because I was going through a  difficult time in my life. I had just moved cities and schools, and I  had left behind all of my childhood friends and almost everything that  was a constant in my life. This happened when I was a young teenager and  it was the worst experience of my life. At the time, I struggled  greatly with understanding my emotions and with social anxiety. It took  many months for me to finally come to terms with my situation and to get  out of denial. For a long time, I tried to convince myself that my  situation was okay and that everything would be alright. I struggled  with anxiety, with depression, and with many more problems.

With that being said, the story has a happy ending; I got closure and  I now live a life where I am generally happy and motivated. My point  with this entire story is that sometimes our life experiences lead us to  philosophies that serve as defence mechanisms. Nihilism, as well as the  belief that free will does not exist, allowed me to tell myself, “life  is meaningless, and I have no control over my situation”. Nihilism was  an escape. The rose-coloured glasses that I had been so accustomed to  wearing had turned into dark-coloured glasses. I was seeing the world  through a completely different lens. When we feel that there is no  meaning in life, it’s probably because something has gone terribly wrong  in our lives.

Of course, this is not always the case. There are plenty of nihilists  out there that believe in nihilism because they believe it to be the  most logical framework for understanding the world. However, as  mentioned earlier in this article, logic is not the only way to go about  looking for truth and examining topics such as the meaning of life;  emotions and instincts are sometimes just as important. An obsession  with logic leads to skepticism. David Hume demonstrated this with “the  problem of induction”. The problem of induction essentially explains  that nothing in the Universe can be proven for certainty. The problem of  induction, as mind-boggling as it is, demonstrates that the odds of the  sun rising tomorrow are equal to the odds of the sun not rising  tomorrow. That is the problem when we put logic on a pedestal and don’t  consider other important factors.

Nihilism is not natural because it looks at the world through a  pessimistic and defeatist lens, which is antithetical to how we are  wired and to who we are as human beings. No baby is born a nihilist.  Going back to Ayn Rand’s quote, “It is not in the nature of man–nor of  any living entity–to start out by giving up, by spitting in one’s own  face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose  rapidity differs from man to man.”

With closure, with life experiences, with the process of slowly  improving, with information on how to deal with grief, and with  knowledge on life and existence, I went from being a nihilist to the  person I am today, the person I have always truly been; someone who  looks at the world with a glass half-full, someone who looks at the  world with curiosity, wonder and love, and someone who believes in  meaning, pursues meaning, and lives a life of meaning.

To further emphasize my point that life has meaning, and that  striving for meaning is natural and a core part of who we are, let’s  look at the science. Psychologist Jordan Peterson talks about the  orienting reflex in many of his lectures online. He explains that our  brain produces a very complex internal model of the world, and that our  senses produce a model of the external world. The hippocampus watches  those two models to see if they match, and if they don’t match, then a  mismatch signal is created; the orienting reflex.

* The orienting reflex is an organism’s immediate response to a  change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to  elicit the startle reflex. The orienting reflex is a reaction to novel  or significant stimuli.

The orienting reflex essentially serves as a compass of meaning for  us; it is an instrument that guides us through life. It is one of the  deepest instincts that we have. The best way to articulate this point is  by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, M. J. DeMarco:

* “Your soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced  with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or  during a massage. How are you responding to your soul’s voice? Is it  denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work?  Distracted by a television? Honored?”

When we are wasting time and when we are indulging in behaviours and  activities that lack meaning, that are unnatural, and that are  antithetical to growth, our orienting reflex will let us know. It is our  responsibility to listen to our voice, to accept the mistakes that  we’ve made, and to take steps towards the right direction. Life is  filled with meaning. We must open our eyes and we must embrace this  meaning. Meaning is a core part of who we are, and we must live in  accordance to the instincts and purposes that have been explained and  analyzed in this article. Furthermore, we must also not follow  philosophies and ideas blindly and dogmatically, and we must understand  that the journey of life and the journey of meaning is unique to each of  us.

This article was a collection of thoughts from some of the greatest  thinkers of all time, as well as my own thoughts and my attempt to  synthesize all of this information. It is worth noting that someone  might read this article and not agree with everything. That is okay, and  it is completely normal. Each of us are at a different stage in our  process of life, and we come from different environments and have  different genetics. Despite the objective nature of some of these ideas,  the way I view life and the way you view life will not always be the  same. Two of the most important skills one can have are self-awareness  and critical thinking. If we are able to understand ourselves and our  thought process, and if we are able to question ourselves and to  question the world, then we have what it takes to grow as human beings  and to tackle difficult questions such as “what is the meaning of life?

Best of luck my fellow readers. Please feel free to reach out to me to ask any questions or to discuss some of these ideas!"
"Defeating the ""what about humans?"" argument for veganismMany people have effectively argued that we shouldn't eat meat from factory farms or other farms where animals are raised in bad conditions. For the purposes of this post I'll just assume this position.

But some go further and argue that it is wrong even to raise an animal for food in a good environment. Even if its life is good with positive well-being, it's still wrong to create such animals, therefore animal farming is always wrong. This doesn't make a lot of sense on its face: it's *good for* the animal, it has a *happy* life, how can it be wrong to kill it? But the vegans have a defense: imagine if they did this to humans. Would you support raising humans and then killing them for food? Of course not! It's barbaric! And so the vegan wins the argument.

There is one line of response to this which says that humans deserve rights which animals don't. Even though both animals and humans are moral patients, and both deserve not to suffer unnecessarily, humans (and whatever rare or hypothetical animals happen to have human-like levels of rational thinking, social standing, cognition, etc) also have special rights not to be raised and slaughtered. Thus, it's consistent to say that it's wrong to farm humans but not wrong to (humanely) farm animals.

That's one response, which I won't go into here. Agree or disagree with it at your leisure. Instead I will show how we can respond to the vegan argument while preserving a fully welfare-oriented perspective. And the first way to do that is to simply deny the assumption that farming humans would be wrong.

We can take it for granted that doing this in *reality* doesn't make sense: there would be too many social problems, it would be extremely economically inefficient, etc. Even if we allowed, say, consenting parents to produce and slaughter an infant, that would generate enough pure outrage and family tension to far outweigh the minor nutritional and gustatory benefits. 

However, let's imagine a world where people can be raised for food and it actually 'works'. E.g., suppose that aliens have watch over the Earth and they beam people away for euthanasia as they get older, something universal and predictable just like natural old age death. And suppose the aliens had planted humans on Earth just for this purpose. Is that better than Earth being an empty world? To me, it seems like it is better. I would rather live on such a world than have no life at all. 

Also, there is no need to restrict our focus to meat. Humans (and animals) could be raised and sacrificed for a wide number of things. For instance, it could be for organs - which I think we can commonly agree is no different from being raised and sacrificed for meat, except for the fact that organs are more important (they could save lives).

More interestingly, humans could be raised for sacrifice in other ways. Imagine that you are a Star Wars clone trooper who is tasked with guarding a robotic mining operation on another planet. Your job is for economic purposes rather than saving people's lives, you could be killed instantly by a surprise strike (suppose it is inevitable given enough time), but until then you have a decent life, almost no labor and enjoy just hanging around. Is it wrong that the mining company had you cloned, even as you are personally glad for it? I don't see this as the case. Of course, you might prefer an *even better* life (don't we all), but that doesn't change the basic fact that your life is better than nonexistence. Alternatively, rather than being raised for sacrifice, you could be raised for your labor (e.g. you are a cloned miner), still with a better life than nonexistence.

In logical terms, it sure seems like these things are morally equivalent to raising humans for meat, but they don't feel as wrong. How do we square these intuitions? Maybe raising humans for meat and labor are both wrong, or maybe they are both right. Either is possible, but this new perspective does make it easier to accept that raising humans for meat is right. It is no longer the stuff of absurdity, because the alternative is to take the mildly objectionable position that these mining operations are wrong.

But there is a way to draw a moral distinction between the two cases. Combat and mining and other pursuits befit the capacities of a human. Of course they are not perfect, they are not fully utilizing our human abilities. But for practical purposes, they come reasonably close. You need human intelligence and human dexterity to perform these tasks. On the other hand, raising a human for food does *not* befit human capacities. Our human strengths and abilities go unused as we are relegated to doing something that animals could do. Thus, being a soldier or a miner provides a kind of *objective* well-being that we lack when we are playing the role of livestock.

So we could say that farming humans is wrong. Does this condemn humane animal farming? No! Because if we want to be consistent, we must judge animal farming by whether it befits *their* capacities, not human ones. To be sure, even on a humane farm, animals are not completely fulfilling all their roles and making use of all their unique abilities. But that is true for the human soldiers and miners anyway. These humans utilize their capacities to a *decent degree*, and humanely raised livestock utilize their capacities to a *decent degree* (they eat, they grow, they run around, etc). When you combine this with perfectly adequate pleasure and little amount of pain, things are good overall. Things don't have to be perfect in order to be good.

In summary, there are two viable ways to provide a welfarist response to the vegan *reductio ad absurdum* against humane farming. The first is to outright deny that farming humans is, in principle, a bad thing. The second is to say that humans raised for food will necessarily have less *objective well being* than animals who are raised for food, because they are not being raised for the capacities befitting their species. When humans are economically raised purely for a purpose that does befit our species capacities (such as combat or mining), that is morally equivalent to humane animal farming, and both are better than nonexistence."
"A Human Brain is not a ComputerIt troubles me that a lot of modern thinkers believe that the human brain is a computer. It has become part of the zeitgeist that we are going to achieve true artificial intelligence otherwise known as Strong AI and that the computer will become self aware like man is. But I believe that this thinking is partly due to the current limited knowledge we have of how the brain really operates as ,the limits to our understanding of artificial intelligence as well as the lack of a precise mathematical language to properly describe the mechanics of our own consciousness. 

But from what we do currently know about computation we can say that it all depends of definite rules. A computer program is governed by these rules. A computer as such cannot move beyond the rules that govern it. If we consider creativity to be a human trait. And if we consider this creativity to be indeed an act of creating something new from nothing, then we can deduce that no program can be written to produce creative artefacts. Think of a novel as an example. If the ideas and stories in that novel are truly new, then no computer program can be written to produce it. As a computer program has to rely on rules that will determine the structure of a novel.

Another objection I have against the idea of Strong AI, is that advocates dismiss the homunculus agent of our minds. This is how we perceive the world, through a first person experience that drives our desires expresses our thoughts and basically conducts an internal dialogue within us. To know how Strong AI advocates view an AI robot, try to mute out your internal thoughts and guide yourself by only what you see and by reasoning outputs. You will not be able to. The AI advocates respond that the first person experience is an illusion. Yet no human being can experience himself without this experience. And it is this experience who is the creative author of our lives. He produces creative ideas. He produces the will in us. At the same time, no investigation of computers have been able to produce a place where such an illusion can exist within it. A computer is thus a turing machine that operates mechanically without this first person experience.

I believe that given that experience if we want to model a human being as a computer, we will have to model him as a system consisting of a Turing Machine and a programmer who is programming this Turing machine. The programmer is the first person experience and is not a program or a Turing Machine. This all reduces to this system to a Human being and not a computer. A computer doesn’t have this first person programmer and cannot produce it on its own.

But because of the lack of a mathematical language that describes consciousness thinkers are able to speculate about he brain being a computer with no way of knowing for sure unless they try to build one. And even if they fail they will believe that they need a more powerful computer. It is only when we have a precise language to describe consciousness that we will truly be able to distinguish between Man and Machine.

"Why We're All Going to Die“Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”- John F. Kennedy

 

The only way out is through. Global society is dependent on artificially inflated energy resources—i.e. oil—that are directly leading us toward total collapse. Technology is being used to most efficiently maximize wealth of the largest corporate conglomerates at the expense of the social fabric and a living environment. The biosphere is in fact collapsing. The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

[iv] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"Answering the Hard Problem of ConciousnessI just have some thoughts that may lay down the beginning paths at a possible solution to such a boggling problem.

So I do not feel the need to define the problem, a simple google search would give plenty of information, but concisely put it concerns itself with the existence of qualia and why they arise. If the world is simply material, why are we not just a complex system of pulleys and levers, why do we have this extra ""immaterial"" feelings/sensations, such as the color of red.

Now on to my thoughts:

First, this hard problem concerns a specific object in the universe, the brain. We are not concerned with a rock, unless you believe in panpsychism. Now it is not weird that we would discover something completely different, such as qualia, emerging in an area that is so unique compared to everything else we have observed in the universe. No where else is there such a high degree of complexity in the universe in such a dense space. The brain has trillions of neurons and they are heavily interconnected. The brain is also dynamic, with change in activity and physical structures.

Now what is the purpose of the brain? For basic life it was to ensure future survival and reproduction through more complicated, coordinated, and regular activity. As it developed it produced the more conscious human, where not only does it still maintain your autonomous functions, but also facilitates your conscious experience. You can think, remember, and imagine. But all those activities all concern with current/future actions. Either you are trying to think of what to do next, or how to do what you have a goal set out for, or you could even be replaying a beautiful memory for the present positive feeling it gives you among a variety of reasons.

So essentially the brain is determining what the body should be doing now and what it could be doing in the future through its constant activity. This will be important.

Next note, dimensions as I see them. The zeroth dimension is a point, its an object of indeterminate size. Put them in a row and you get a line, this is one dimensional. But those in a row you get a plane, this is two dimensional. Put those in a row you got a cube, this is three dimensional. This is where most people think we hit our limit. But if you were to pause the universe and think of the whole thing as one 3-d frame, or if you were to put it in the box, it would be one cube of specifically arrange atoms. Play for 1 infinitesimally  small unit of time and then pause again. This is a very similar 3-D frame, or a cube of similarly arranged atoms. So this is time, and this is how you row up cubes, and you get the fourth dimension. Now humans are very complicated patterns from the 4-d perspective, persisting in the 4rth dimension for 70-80 years or even longer. 

But if that was all that we were, we would be the zombie that Chalmers speaks of. We would be moving robots of atoms, but with no real qualia or cartesian theaters. 

But I argue that we are instead existing in the fifth dimension, which could give a perspective on why we have qualia, this seemingly ineffable class of experience that truly make up everything we know. So what would the fifth dimension be? It would be lining up all the lined up 3-d freeze frames of the universe. You would have movement between 3-d blocks at the same exact time, t, and this could be understood through different true realities occuring at moments where there are multiple next possible 3-d frames of the universe. A basic example to get my point across would be the electron, where it is in the super positioned state of being a wave or particle. Here there are two 3-d block freeze frames of the universe for the same time t. How does the universe choose? It doesn't need to, both exist. And this could be generally tolerated because the electron is subatomic, and thus in the spooky quantum realm.

But what if there was a macro level object that could also be in such a super positioned state, where there are multiple true future freeze frames of the universe with slight differences within the macro level object for the same time t?
Well if there was this object would have to be very consistent through time and very very complex to not simply be following a standard frame by frame path according to standard physical laws. 

The brain is the obvious answer. So the brain, which I argued has a fundamental goal of determining the best possible future state for the person, could have multiple simultaneously true future states as it moves through time, that are all equally true and real according to the fundamental laws of the universe. So this consciousness which seems to determine our actions and exist through qualia, is truly a pattern in the fifth dimension, navigating through simultaneously true realities.
"
"Consciousness, cosmos, meI have written this in order to help me keep my ideas in order, but I thought I would share it in case someone shares my feelings. I suspect I don't meet any standards but my own and that anything of value has already been said.

**Introduction**


It is inherently apparent to a conscious being that there is more to reality than material mechanism, any account of reality which does not feature this is massively incomplete. I feel that this is only questioned because consciousness is a “supernatural” phenomena - it cannot be detected by our senses and even worse we all feel we have special private evidence of its existence, this understandably makes it an awkward subject for the scientific methodology. 


The picture of the world we have built has nothing resembling consciousness, there is no place for it, and this is not a minor discrepancy.


It is simple to demonstrate the problem: if you ask what is happening in the brain, you end up with the complete description of the neurological activity of the brain, but in the case of the brain you have to ask also what it is like to be that activity, so why, contrasted with every other system in the world, do you have to ask that question?


There is I think also a desire to explain away consciousness because it is the world of meaning, and we must not have a universe that is involved with meaning. Matter, which has responded so well to our inquiries and explains so many things, is implicitly taken as primary and so mind must be explained in terms of it, mind must come from matter in some way, it is an illusion that certain kinds of material things have. 


The western scientific project has been extraordinarily successful in explaining countless phenomena, and so consciousness has come to be viewed as one phenomena among many that were once equally as mysterious, bound to fall inevitably to the same methods, but consciousness is by its nature absolutely singular and cannot be regarded as such.


I believe that consciousness is key to our understanding the nature of reality, because it is the only thing about it that matters, without it nothing is of any significance whatsoever.


**An indication**

When considering the place of consciousness within reality, it is informative to ask what it is it can do that a “blind” physical body alone could not manage ie. what do you contribute?. I assert that there is no function that could not be achieved by unfeeling mechanism ie. you could take anything done with feeling and replicate it in a robot without, therefore consciousness does not exist because it is physically useful and such a “pragmatic” view of the reason for consciousness and more importantly of the operating principles of reality is invalid. I am not here because I am needed by my body, my body could cope on its own -  is my body here because I need it? simply put consciousness is not a necessary aspect of systems which do the things which animals do.


It could be said that consciousness is evidently biologically useful since we conscious creatures have conquered the planet, however, nothing that I do that is beneficial to the human organism is done consciously, I do not know how I think or move, I am not useful in this way. The organism does not need to indicate things to me with signals of feelings in order to get my input, since it is the organism that knows how to do the things it needs to do.
When I consider what my conscious experience consists of, it is clear that my experiencing is not of any particular use, it seems that it happens simply for the sake of my experiencing it.


It is vital to state definitively that there would be no way for a purely blind mechanistic system, as it is suggested the universe is, to develop and support consciousness, no matter if it was needed to win a survival race. The hierarchical view of reality with physics being the primary concern of nature and consciousness a product of this is shown up. There is more to reality than physics and its accidental by-products, a system with consciousness is a special kind of system.


Another important thing to consider is why it should have been that creatures with the very special property of consciousness emerged from the evolutionary process at all, I cannot help but believe in a teleological cosmos for reasons which I shall try to express in the next section.


**A tendency**


Consciousness is singular and is absolutely the most significant thing about reality, it stands out among all other things known about the universe.


We know that consciousness is possible, so it seems it would be a tremendous waste if reality didn’t use this potential, therefore I suspect that it deliberately moves towards creating it, I feel it cannot be an accident that the universe came to be such that it supports conscious experience.


**Free Will**


Free will is a central aspect of our experience of the world and yet I find it is impossible even to define what freedom could mean when looked at with familiar notions of systems, I assert that it is impossible from this viewpoint - however, we experience free will, could we if it were impossible? I assert that there is nothing to gain from our having an illusion of freedom, except from the flawed perspective which I have encountered occasionally, namely that consciousness is a series of tricks on us, designed for example to help us be social, the flaw is that there should be no self that needs to be tricked in this picture, only an organism that works with itself and does not worry about things like freedom and whether it is conscious.


In a purely physical universe there is no room for anything but bottom-up causation which propagates from the most primitive parts upwards, as addressed earlier I take it for granted that this picture is massively incomplete. If I am able to decide, then consciousness has the final say on what the stuff of the physical universe actually does, which is a good indicator that the physicalist hierarchy is invalid.


**A Conspiracy**


There is no way for components of a system like a brain to come together to achieve some holistic effect like consciousness, a unified experience emerging from separated brain ‘modules’ or neurons, this would require a conspiracy - reality working in favour of consciousness, which is not allowed in a universe that features minds as an afterthought. 

To view parts as a system requires a perspective of some sort. It is simple to demonstrate the problem here: imagine that the components of a brain are made to communicate via radio instead of their usual signalling mechanism, nothing should change, imagine then that they receive their signals from a computer recording of the brain’s previous activity - nothing changes from their perspective but from ours they are not forming a system at all and we would not allow for holistic properties.


The tying of the specific experience that is mine to a single brain is a peculiar thing, it means that when I die my brain could be digested by the earth and still be reassembled, resuming the experience that is me, this is problematic because there should then be no reason to distinguish between pieces of matter that were part of me and those that were not, I can conclude from this sort of experiment only that the existence of self at least introduces a complicating factor into the universe.


Finally, if some necessary condition for consciousness to appear in systems is found, it will not be sufficient, a reality which somehow grants consciousness to such systems is required.


I conclude that there must be a conspiracy in favour of consciousness which is not accounted for by physicalist accounts of reality, I think it is a solid assumption that the brain is something which taps into an already existent piece of reality.


**Cosmos**


This universe is not strictly physical, there is no question that experience is part of what is going on, but what is the significance of consciousness?
Some will not consider that life and the “fine-tuning” enabling its appearance is any indicator of a meaningful universe, they say there is some life here because there is bound to be some amongst an infinity of possible universes that exist, the extravagance of this explanation and its materialist bias is such that I lean towards a universe that has something to do with consciousness.


The earth is not the only planet and we are not the only species, it is important to some to stress that we are insignificant, especially given our size relative to even our own sun, but I cannot see that a conscious experience is a small thing, it does not have size as it is not a physical object, and we are each the center of an experience which seems complete.


The physical universe is something that exploded out from a single point, it is an expression, and conscious experiences are impressions of this, the universe being an expression means that it has something to express which it deliberately moves towards expressing.


**Conclusion**


My suspicion is that the question of what we are at our core is essential. Beyond our ideas about ourselves as humans and everything which goes with that I think we can say that we are the same identical thing, and anything that is conscious anywhere would be this same thing. This brings me to the hinduistic conclusion that we are the fundamental it having experiences, we are existence, we are as divine as things get.


The universe is something which blossoms deliberately into experiences, and I believe that this is the purpose of everything. To be experiencing and to be the universe is the most exciting thing imaginable, when I feel this way I feel alive."
"The Possibility of Knowing Thyself: Impressions, Triangulation and why Theories aren't Subjective**Thesis** Part of the reason philosophy exist. Part of the reason philosophy developed naturally. Part of the reason philosophy continues to persist is that it answers some questions that are otherwise unanswerable. These questions take over the limits of science and art, yet we wish to talk about them. And beyond science and art, we can only talk about these subjects in a philosophical manner.

""Philosophical manner"" meaning that philosophical answers aim to answer questions about objectivity and subjectivity without trivializing either one.

One of the question is not so much a direct question but a commandment from one of western philosophy's founding member: Socrates. Socrates directed his followers to know thyself indirectly by the famous dictum: The Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living.

That is, the life you live and are living right now is not worth anything unless you examine it. Like gold in itself is worthless unless you know what properties it has. And you can only know the properties of gold by examining it.

In this post I aim to talk about the framework all humans find themselves in in this endeavor as we seek to find ourselves and make our lives worth living and how we can discover the properties that enrich our lives.
_____________________________________
**Part {1}**

You're an idea. 

Or rather an idea is essential to your being.

Try to exist without having an idea on your mind. This may arguably be possible, for example, through sleep or meditation. But other than in special circumstances, wherever you go you go with an idea on your mind.

The only way to start off defining yourself is going through the idea barrier. Without an idea you cannot exist. To prove you exist, you need an idea first.  

___________________________________

**Part {2}**

To be something is to be that. 

So whatever you are is a reference to what you are. But to make a reference to what you are you have to be something that is referenced or capable of being referenced. 

To reference means to point to something. When you're referencing yourself you're pointing at yourself.

You cannot, however, just point to yourself and find yourself. It's like saying ""A is A"". An ""A"" is worthless without knowing its properties, its relations to other letters, or how it can benefit/enrich you from using it. 

If you point at something that is you, you have to be both the subject and the object in question.

You have to be (1) something that is subjectively evaluating an objective thing and you have to be (2) an objective thing that is being referenced.

___________________________________
**Part {3}**

When we reference an apple, we first get an apple and call it an apple. Then we compare an apple to what an apple is not.

If the apple is red, then we say that the apple is red. But the apple is red because it's not any other color.

The positive and negative qualities are intimately tied. Just because the apple is not blue doesn't mean it's yellow. The apple is both red and not blue. It's not just not (any color but red). The apple is red and not (any color but red).

Why an apple is red can be explained or reasoned in many different ways:

1. We can talk about lights waves 
2. apple genetics 
3. the climate that allowed for red apples to emerge 
4. the environment that favored red apples to continue existing vs different color apples that may have gone extinct or never given a chance to flourish 
5. our vocabulary that says ""red means this particular phenomena"" and an apple that adheres to that definition (""An apple is red because red it word we use to describe the phenomena that the apple is exhibiting"")
6. Etc

Some of these truths are absolutely true no matter the context. Light waves and apple genetics may be true for everyone and everything; regardless if they can understand the concept or not. 

When it comes to vocabulary, we may transfer truths to one another using words but only if those words are grounded in truth AND we agree on the meaning of the words.

We could have a debate that seems contradictory. One side may argue that the apple is red and another that it's blue. And they may both be right if their use of the word correspond to the same phenomena. 

The important or relevant thing to take away from this is that:

1. our portal towards truth depends on our impression of the world.
2. our impression must be neutralized to reach objectivity. 
3. our impression of the world and absolute truth are indistinguishable/inseparable (our impression of everything and anything is founded/reasoned through truths that exist independent of our impressions and that in itself is a truth)
4. our impression of the world is a mixture of truth and subjectivity

We can remove our personal subjectivity in order to concentrate truth (science) or we can indulge in our subjectivity (art). This isn't relevant but your day to day life is probably a somewhat balance between the two.

_______________________________________________
**Part {4}**

To know thyself is to concentrate the truth of your subjectivity. 

Let's say you're colorblind so that an apple I call red you see as forest green. You would live with subjective truths that are based on impressions that may include:

1. It's difficult for you to distinguish between forest green plates and red apple slices laying on top of the plate
2. There are colors that other people can see that you can't
3. There's something in your body that affects the impression you have of the world that results in not seeing things other people see
4. You don't know and can't know the impression non-colorblind people have of red apples

Everything I said in the first half of **Part {3}** can be known by the colorblind person and everything I listed here can be known by the non-colorblind person.

That's because the lists are ideas commenting on truths. They are ideas that beg the question with goal of justifying them. They are ideas that presuppose a foundation for reality. But the ultimate justification is your impression. Not the actual absolute truth that exist independent of you; since its only value is your dependence of it. And your dependence of it is based on impressions.

That's why any scientific question can lead to an ad infinitum ""why"" until it's stopped by ""well that's how far science has gotten us thus far"" or ""well, that's a different field of study."" Although science is humanity's best hope to cure diseases, stabilize inequality, end suffering, and create technological advancement. This isn't criticism or lampooning science. Since each discipline/gaze/etc is limited in scope and science is no exception.

Ideas that comment on truths are called theories or hypothesis. But not all ideas comment on truths. And not all truths need to be unearthed or discovered. Some truths are self-evident. For example, our impression is self-evident and true. And yet our impression of the world begs the question because it's an idea that instinctively and instantly comments on further truth that are not self-evident. 

We can then contribute to the impression of the world through art. Or we can deduce our impression of the world through science.

Necessarily, art carries with it scientific truths that can be uncovered and at the same time scientific truths affect our perspective of our art and artistic unfolding. So even the illusion of removing subjectivity is merely an illusion.

________________________________
**Part {5}**

I'm not a dualist. I favor a threesome perspective. That is founded on triangulation.

To know yourself you first have to find yourself. And as with any mathematical problem or navigation, you need at least two knowns or two coordinates to find yourself. 

I would argue that to find and know thyself you need absolutely need two broad coordinates: Absolute Truth and you. 

The difference between the two is that while you're founded on absolute truth, absolute truth is impermeable. You're not impermeable. You're tainted by subjectivity. You are a changing thing based on the changing universe. It's true that sometimes you're cold and sometimes you're hot. Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad. You regard some things as morally good and other things as morally bad. And what those things are sometimes change and sometimes they don't. But all of it is based on absolute truth. 

Change is part of absolute truth. Everything changes constantly. Any impression of the physical world being stagnant or stationary is an illusion based on impressions. Based on truth and subjectivity. 

It's like a video game that changes maps. The buttons you press are always the same to achieve the desired results.

There may be games that change the button layout each map so that you have to re-adjust, but there is still a foundation of truth that guides the change. There's still an objective. You cannot play a game without there being an objective. Regardless if the objective is created by the game creators or yourself. To move, to think, to do requires a plane where you can triangulate yourself. Whether that's space and time or morality or a video game.

Ultimately, to know thyself is to be aware of how you define what you define. Because the part of you that is based on absolute truth is unchanging and consistent. But it's not physical. It's based on principles that transcend the physical since its properties are evident but inconsistent with how the physical behaves.

______________________________________
**Counterarguments**

On whether **Part {1}** is just Cartesian skepticism: I'm not saying that the physical world can be trivialized or that your ideas take precedence to the physical world. I'm saying that as soon as you start talking, you're bringing an idea to life. You cannot talk or think or exist without bringing an idea to life. Even if you exist without thought there's no way to know you exist because to know you exist is a thought. 

The idea itself can be like a plant that sprouts. We can investigate the origins of the plant and its makeup or we can analyze the plant itself. But you cannot start to talk without there being an idea associated. Your words and thoughts are part of the nutrients that give the plant life, among other things.

One may argue ""what if we program a robot to say 'I exist' or 'I am'"".

I think this goes back to the fundamental question of how can you know thyself.

Doing one of those fancy European philosophy moves we can see it another way. The euro step? No that's basketball. I mean the flipping something on it's head in a very French way.

Asking ""what happens if a robot says 'I exist'"" is the same thing as saying what happens when a rock says ""I exist"" or if another human says ""I exist.""

We can only know they exist insofar as we can see they exist (either artistically or scientifically). The same thing when you yourself say ""I exist."" You exist insofar as you can see yourself.

You see yourself when you express yourself. Sometimes you express yourself and only you can see the expression. Or sometimes you express yourself but only you have the perspective you have (since each person has their own perspective). Either way, you can simultaneously express yourself and see yourself since your perspective is a further expression of you. 

Although usually we express ourselves first and after a while reflect on ourselves. 

In short, we can deduce an existential being exist or not (and in what ways it exists) based on pragmatism. And that pragmatism can be led by science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two. 

Concerning ""science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two,"" we naturally combine both. Furthermore, we can't influence one part without influencing the other. But this unfolding also feeds into who you are and what you can reflect on.

It's bad philosophy to introduce a concept at the end (such as pragmatism) but moving on, your being observes the universe. Your being is indirectly observing absolute truth. And our subjectivity shines a light on different truths that depend on our subjectivity.

We can put our subjectivity aside by cancelling it out in theory and militarize pragmatism in a scientific context and discover ""objective truths"" but even without doing this, your subjectivity runs into objective truths all the time. It's just that our subjectivity measures truth less accurately than science. Although to an equally true degree. 

The only way to measure truth more accurately is through pragmatic effort, then. To DO something first and see what results. Evaluate what you see. Whether it's something artistic or scientific or if it's evaluation artistically or scientifically. To do something, anything, and then to triangulate that something with absolute truth to find yourself. Yourself being a union of the two and thus a triangulation of who you are. If we are to equate who you are with where you are. But finding where you are is the first step of finding thyself.

"Transhumanism - Your thoughts, emotions, fears, inhibitions? And how long will we remain human? What does it mean to BE human?Hello r/philosophy,

I'd like to take a few minutes to open a discussion regarding transhumanism, or the integration of cybernetics/technology with our own biology, and open up a venue for fellow lurkers to present viewpoints for and against it. I can't control anyone else, but I promise I'll respect your opinions as long as you respect my own.

One of the great minds on the forefront of such ideas is **Ray Kurzweil**, a futurist, author and inventor who has spent 30+ years studying a behavior coined ""*exponential growth*,"" in which technology and our understanding of it and our own biology does not statically grow from one stage to the next, but increases by exponential rates every year. Here are some thoughts of his:

>*""By 2029, we’ll have reverse engineered and modeled and simulated all the regions of the brain. And that will provide us the software/algorithmic methods to simulate you know, all of the human brains capabilities including our emotional intelligence. And computers at that time will be far more powerful than the human brain. And we’ll be able to create machines that really do have subtlety and suppleness of human intelligence. And they’ll combine that power with ways in which machines are already superior to us. They can impart us all of human knowledge with the few keystrokes, it can remember billions of things accurately. They can share knowledge in electronic speeds that are million times faster than the human language.""*

>*""...20 years, 25 years, these nanobots, these blood cell size devices will be going in our bodies keeping us healthy from inside. We’ll have some go inside our brains to the capillaries not invasively, there would be interacting with our biological neurons so it’ll extends our memory, our decision making faculties, put our brains on the internet and they also enable us to enter virtual reality environment from within the nervous system.""*

Another pioneer in the venture of Cybernetics is [Kevin Warwick](http://bigthink.com/ideas/39801), the first *human cyborg*. Professor Warwick, with artificial implants, was able to control a mechanical hand thousands of miles away by ""jacking his nervous system into the internet."" He has also done extensive research into biological-robotics, including a small robot with a ""brain."" Warwick is convinced that man must integrate with machine in order for us to survive and evolve as a species.

**Some other questions I have:**

* When will we have reached the point in which we are no longer *human*? If technology consist of tools created by humans to extend our own human abilities, how are these *not* human?

* For those of faith, do you believe it an *abomination* or an *act against God* to pursue the halting of biological death, or at least postponing it? Do you believe that we are meant to accept death as a part of life, and to attempt to stop that is, essentially, an affront against what we were ""meant"" to experience?

* When do you think AI will be created, if ever? Furthermore, what is your definition of AI? Some, like myself, would argue that we already have narrow, ""primitive"" AI within our everyday lives.

* Does the thought of SkyNet happening scare you?

* What are some possible ethical/moral laws and regulations that should be put into place as we move into the integration of cybernetics and human biology?

* I believe the most important question, though, is very simple: what does it mean to be *human*?

**TL;DR: SkyNet: Yay or nay?**

*I know that there are a lot of people that may not agree with the people/sources I've mentioned in this post, but that doesn't mean that we cannot discuss the possibilities for our coming future and the transition into technological mastery. I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of this.*

EDIT: I just realized there are already two or three threads dealing with technology and AI. I promise, I wasn't attempting to piggy-back off of these ideas."
"Happiness and Ignorance or Appreciation and Wisdom?As John Stuart Mill said in his Utilitarianism: ""It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied"". The question that immediately comes to mind when reading this quotation is: “Is this true?” Is wisdom really worth more than satisfaction? Would one truly rather be happy and ignorant than face the absurdity of live and – thereby – reality? That is, a happy fool or an enlightened absurdist; what to choose?

You can look in the mirror every morning and think to yourself: ""You are going to be wiped away from this earth within – at most – a few decades"", ""You don't have a clue what you are doing here and you are very likely never to figure it out"" and ""What is the value of what I am about to do today?"" All of these are questions that – from a philosophical point of view – seem perfectly reasonable. Philosophy – as being the human quest for wisdom – should not turn away its head from questions like these, even though they might appear to be unanswerable. Philosophy is not a human endeavor that should be focused upon creating finished products, like a carpenter or a blacksmith does. Philosophy – like any realm of thought that tries to obtain ""the truth"" – is a never-ending activity whose value lies in calming down our sense of despair. It might be comparable to drugs, however, instead of deciding not to face the absurdity of life by lowering one's state of consciousness, one tries to convince one's consciousness that there must be a road to clarity; a road that one – in full naivety – strives to find.

But there is another way to live one’s life. One could – after all – look in the mirror every morning and think: ""I've got to hurry up, I have to be at work at 8 o'clock"", ""I still have to tell John that he has to cook dinner tonight because I will be late"" and ""Oh it's Tuesday! That means that there will be soccer on television this evening!” One could try to force oneself to try and turn off one’s mind and commit oneself to living the robotic life. One could try to become immersed in the rat-race called life to such an extent that all of one's thinking power is required just for sticking to one’s rat-race planning. There is no time for reflection, just for action. The current consists of the ever recurring 9 to 5 trajectory stringed together by knots of transient and superficial happiness.

The advantage of being a happy fool is that one – in contrast to the absurdist – is able to experience happiness, no matter how superficial this might be. The fool is able to get lost in the dopamine-flow pouring from the utter irrelevance of the phenomena he finds amusing. And although the happy fool might have turned his back to the absurdity of life, he lives his life the normal way, the way in which almost everyone does it. Moreover, it is the manner in which any animal on earth lives its life. And that's where the sadness kicks in. Since, one could ask, how human is a life that doesn't differ in any fundamental sense of the life of a pig? A life that is lived on cruise-control, only taken control of when one’s biological urges are incapable of doing the job? Humans equal sheep equal mice. And although we have the thinking power at our disposal, we rather let our animal brains control our bodies. No thinking means good thinking.

And there is where Socrates comes in. Although Socrates realizes that he might not have chosen the path to happiness in the hedonistic sense of the word, the outer part of his brain gets freed from the shackles of social and biological conditioning and takes control of his life. Happiness gets bypassed, and fulfillment is being striven for. And it is by accepting the inability of his mind to ever find the path leading to certainty, that he enters a vicious circle that starts and ends with absurdity, which is the highest state of enlightenment and reason obtainable through the mind. It is only in the absurdist spheres of one’s consciousness that happiness can be judged for what it is: an empty goal created to prolong the dominance of the animalistic parts of our brain.

Should we see it as our duty to enlighten ourselves, to reach the level dominated by reflection and the non-emotional driven sense of appreciated ignorance? Or should we succumb under the temptation of hedonism and its shots of temporarily happiness? Happiness or absurdism; what is the human way to live?

Creating robots capable of moral reasoning is like parenting – Regina Rini
"Humans and Artificial Intelligence Can't Form Real Friendships (Yet). Can humans and artificially intelligent robots form friendships? To explore this question, the term 'friendship’ must be defined. Many definitions of friendship are inspired by Greek philosopher Aristotle. He argues that friendships are characterized by the utility and pleasure that can be gained from a relationship, as well as the sharing of virtues and ideals. These criteria may seem to convey that friendships are motivated by self-interest. However, while the principles of utility and pleasure imply that friendships are founded on self-interest, the final principle of virtue sharing lies in the benefits they bestow on the participants. They aren’t necessarily mutually enriching. The final principle of virtue sharing conveys that friendships are different from other kinds of relationships because they require mutual benefit.

To examine if humans can form friendships with inanimate objects that emulate human life, two cases will be presented to establish a concrete example of how humans can form relationships with inanimate objects that resemble human life. The first case involves a man from Michigan who is married and claims to have a mistress, although neither of them are human. They are synthetic, robotic dolls. The man from Michigan promotes love with artificial beings and claims that they are happy together.

The second case involves a military bomb-disposal robot that was destroyed on a battlefield in Iraq. He was given a formal military funeral and was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star medallion. The soldiers working with the robot felt they owed him the respect of proper military recognition. The soldiers claim that the robot developed a personality of its own and he had saved their lives on many occasions.

These kinds of experiences are not exceedingly uncommon and illustrate the notion that humans can form powerful emotional attachments to non-living objects, especially if they resemble humans or human behavior. Even simple, non-living objects such as photographs of loved ones that have passed away can carry strong emotional sediment. Concerning robots, humans can certainly fulfill Aristotle’s criteria of utility and pleasure from machines, as their creation is meant to fulfill these very purposes. However, to determine whether a robot benefits from a relationship with a human, the desires of the robot should be examined. Robots don’t seem to possess any desires at all. They are machines devoid of free will. Therefore, in their current state, robots can’t fulfill Aristotle’s notion of virtue sharing and mutual benefit.

The developments of ‘artificial intelligence’ are meant to fulfill the theory of computer systems being able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. The question of if friendships can ever truly be formed between humans and robots is reliant on determining if robots can ever become truly alive, which suggests that robots would possess free will, their own desires, and autonomy. The criteria and classification of life according to leading modern secular thought are as follows: “All life is highly ordered and structured; all life reproduces itself; all life grows and develops to reach maturity; all life takes in and utilizes energy to carry out the functions of its components, which results in growth and development; all living things exhibit homeostasis; all living things respond to their environment by sensing external stimuli and changing their body to fulfill a behavior; and, finally, all living things adapt to external pressures, and evolve because of them.”

While this list of characteristics may be incomplete or contested by various demographics, such as religious groups or other such conflicting philosophies, it can be argued that artificial intelligence will soon be able to accomplish all of these characteristics, as programs such as viruses are already able to proliferate, reproduce, utilize energy, and so forth. In light of this prediction, robots should then be assessed as to whether they truly experience a desire to form a friendship with a human and recognize any mutual benefits. So long as artificial intelligence functions by a set of behaviors originated by their initial programming, it can be argued that robots can never satisfy this mutually satisfying condition because robots can never have truly autonomous free will. They wouldn't truly express desires, as they don’t have their own values or beliefs. In this sense, the characteristics of life in a robot could be thought of as deceptions that mislead us as to the true nature of the robot. In this sense, a higher form of life capable of forming friendships can be characterized by free will and autonomy, as well as the conventional characteristics of life.

In conclusion, so long as robots obey a set of behaviors as determined by computer programming rather than the innate mechanisms that bring forth free will and autonomy, this essay concludes that the developments of artificial intelligence is not currently sufficient for humans to develop ‘friendships’ with robots, according to Aristotle's definition of friendship. The driving force that compels humans to possess free will and autonomy currently seem to be incompatible with the driving forces of artificial intelligence that emulate life. The criterion of mutual benefaction isn’t fulfilled. The emotional attachments humans feel towards robots perhaps could instead be classified by other forms of relationships rather than ‘friendship’."

"Civilization is the original cause of ecocideI recently read a text called [It’s Not Capitalism that’s Driving Ecocide; it’s Civilization](https://macskamoksha.com/2019/12/not-capitalism), written by Kollibri terre Sonnenblume, and I decided to write something about it. I agree that it is not only capitalism that is driving ecocide and that colonialist society has been doing this since long before. By the title, some people may think that he is saying that capitalism is not a problem, which would be wrong since the text states that “capitalism cannot be reformed and must be dismantled”.

The central point of the text should be read as a question: is it possible to reconcile Marxism and environmentalism? Although eco-socialists guarantee it is, there are some complications to be solved, especially when considering concepts such as “human supremacy”, or anthropocentrism. And with that I am not saying that movements like Earth First are more coherent. I am not in a position to make this assessment.

The problem is that much of ecology and socialism is anthropocentric. Most ecologists and eco-socialists do not criticize civilization. Part of eco-anarchism understands this criticism because it has opened up to other ecological perspectives. The State also cannot be reformed and must be dismantled. The ecological crisis makes capitalism even more contradictory, but the civilizing contradiction has been present since the foundation of class society: the opposition between human beings and other beings.

The question is: how far can eco-socialism go in its critique of the human domain over nature? To reflect on this, we can start by thinking about the [words](https://www.correio24horas.com.br/noticia/nid/vida-sustentavel-e-vaidade-pessoal-diz-ailton-krenak/) of Ailton Krenak : “I put in question whether there is anything possible to think of as sustainable in the urban and modern way of life that we share in various places (…). What activity can be sustainable within such a system? ”

If civilization started ecocide long before capitalism, how can the end of capitalism itself put an end to ecocide? Is a socialist, ecological and sustainable civilization possible?

Continuing with Krenak’s reflection, “food production is certainly not sustainable”. The agricultural revolution (also called the Neolithic revolution) is considered a major advance in human history, as well as the green revolution (use of new technologies to increase agricultural production, starting in the 1960s). But both were disastrous for nature and human life. Biotechnology represents a next step in the same direction, while agroecology promises to reverse the devastating effects of these “revolutions”, turning agriculture into a sustainable practice.

But let us consider sustainability as a myth, or “as a narrative that was created by corporations to continue winning over consumers with the idea that what you are consuming is produced in a sustainable way, but it is a lie”. In this sense, how to know if agroecology is really sustainable?

Even with the most ecological agriculture in the world, it is possible that “the numbers don’t match”, as Krenak says. This is because the needs we have now do not correspond to the naturally sustainable needs for human beings. These are needs created by civilization, which would never be possible without a way of life based on patriarchy, exploitation, accumulation, expansion, invasion, slavery, genocide, epistemicide and ecocide. If in fact “the infrastructure that exists in cities is going to collapse” and “all the attempts in the world to regulate consumption, production, distribution of goods are unsustainable”, what to do?

Well, we know what not to do. We cannot continue to assume the same premises that it is enough to end the waste generated by capitalism, or invest in scientific and technological advances that aim at the common good (of humanity) instead of the profit of companies. This may still be insufficient. Technology gives us extraordinary powers. Can we use all these great powers produced by our techno-scientific “advancement” for the good of all species and the planet as a whole? Is this humanly possible? Is this possible without anthropocentrism or human exceptionalism?

It is necessary to understand that “we are making wrong choices”. Not just capitalists, but we have all been making the wrong choices for a long, long time. Can we assume all the responsibility that comes with the powers granted by technological development? Environmentalists in general do not criticize the technology or the urban way of life itself. On the contrary, they are talking about sustainable cities and green technology. But what if an urban and technological way of life is actually a “trap”, something inherently unsustainable?

Krenak’s proposal is a human society that leaves no trace of its passage through the land. “We leave too much trace and every culture that leaves a trace is unsustainable.” The heart of this idea, for me, goes unnoticed by most people: that we are only passing through here. Not only us as individuals, but humanity as a whole is only here temporarily. That is, humanity needs to have an end. Civilization is, in many ways, the denial of an end. Our culture didn’t lose it’s way, it didn’t become unsustainable due to change in it’s course. It has been unsustainable since the beginning.

We are alienated “in relation to the origin of everything we eat, drink, wear”. But we are also alienated in relation to disposal, that is, the final destination of everything we eat, drink, dress, and even our own final destination. Our way of life, our consumption and our very existence has become unsustainable. That is why trying to be individually “more sustainable” is a “personal vanity”. We won’t change anything if we don’t change everything.

The idea that you can save the planet by doing your part creates “a psychological environment that hides the real reason” of the ecological crisis. The way we are living, in a more fundamental sense than just the economic system, is the cause of the ecological crisis. But we are led to believe that there is no other way to live, since we are in the most “advanced” way, and since we cannot “go back” or “revert time”.

There are other ways to live, but as Krenak says, some of them are “racist and elitist, they suggest that the rich are the ones who know how to live in the world”. This phrase can be reinterpreted in several ways: they suggest that whites are the ones who know how to live in the world. Or the people who created the industrial revolution. Or the people who have created empires. They are the people who created a way of life based on the intensive use of animals and soil. You see? Civilization invented class and poverty.

Can we prevent industrial processes from draining our water? In other words, can we prevent civilization from destroying the world? To cite one of the most difficult problems: how to abandon the use of fossil fuel? As Krenak says, “fossil fuel should have been abandoned in the 1990s”. We knew we had to stop, but we didn’t. Why is it going to be different now?

The hope for a sustainable civilization holds a belief, a modern mythology, which is the “idea of ​​self-sufficiency” of humanity. We believe that everything is possible if we strive. A better system is enough. “With the advancement of what has been called civilization, and with the advent of globalization, this thinking has taken over the entire planet,” says Krenak. Civilization has always tried to be sustainable, and it has always failed to do so. I repeat: why would it be different in a post-capitalist civilization?

The urban experience took us away from nature. The simplicity of this phrase is misleading. Being away from nature is not just not knowing how to live without a refrigerator and a stove. It means, first of all, not remembering WHO you are and what you are doing HERE. “Many values ​​that we have, that we think are fundamental to humanity, have been created and have been instilled in our culture, in our mentality”. They are not values ​​of humanity, they are values ​​of a culture that denies humanity, because it denies nature. Just as it denies life, because it denies death.

This “memory loss” is a central concept. When the poet says “people are not bad, they are just lost”, he reflects an ancestral idea. When someone happened to do something wrong, the other members of the community would come together to REMEMBER that person of the good things they did, that is, make them remember WHO THEY ARE.

Thus, the central question for criticizing ecocide is not: “how to be sustainable”, but “who are we?”, or even, “what is the human being?”. It doesn’t seem like a very pragmatic question, you can protest that we need more action and less philosophy. However, adherence to this silent and unquestioned philosophy of civilization is what brought us to this nightmare.

That is why I consider it so important that Krenak decides to talk about “worldview”, and more specifically, the worldview that “the Earth is a living organism”. This should not be interpreted as a metaphor. It is not about treating the Earth “as if” it were a living organism. If the Earth is really a living organism, everything that civilization has understood about the world is wrong, because all civilized knowledge is based on the objectification of the natural world.

Global warming is just Earth’s fever. It is not the disease itself, but a symptom. Traditional environmentalists focus on treating the symptom, but how to treat the disease? How to diagnose the disease?

The human being is able to survive if left naked in the forest, but is not capable of causing much damage to the environment. To destroy its habitat, it is necessary to create special tools and techniques for this, which have nothing to do with the need for survival. The cultures that did not create these devices “are not engaged in planetary consumption”. If these peoples are the “medicine”, in Krenak’s words, who or what is the disease? As he says, “there are people left outside this civilizing circle who still know, still reflect on a worldview, are protected by this memory and are still capable of thinking other worlds and building other world perspectives”. This suggests that we, civilized, like those who have forgotten who they are, are stuck in a single way of thinking and building the world. Our vision is restricted. The weight of the technical system that we created to change the world as we see fit can be impossible to carry, unsustainable in a deeper sense of the word.

Civilizing techno-culture “is fascinating”, but also “a poison”. “Everyone becomes dependent on this great embrace of the world for apparent human needs.” It is an addiction, as Kollibri also says. Now imagine how difficult it is to get rid of a collective addiction that has dominated us for thousands of years… Of course it seems utopian. But at the same time, nothing could be more unrealistic than staying in that addiction. As it should be clear, the greatest damage of this addiction is not exactly to the Earth, but to the human spirit. In the same way, he who weighs heavily on the life of his own family does more damage to his own self-esteem than to his family.

We have not been able to remove this burden from our conscience. We are experiencing a “dissociation” between human experience and the planet. However, we do not destroy the world without knowing what we are doing. We use all our intelligence in this project. Necrocivilization, to make a parallel with necrocapitalism, placed us in a simulated world, in which we like to be. It makes us pretend that everything is going to be okay, when it obviously isn’t. Obviously the damage we do to the world cannot be simply erased. Like a lie that has been kept at all costs, the consequences of admitting the truth are now necessarily disastrous for us.

“We were converted to an idea of ​​humanity that is not real. It is a post-humanity ”, says Krenak. The humanity that we try to realize cannot come true. The attempt to realize this ideal, running over others, is the civilizing process, “it is the core of colonial thought”. The concepts of civilization and humanity that we use are impregnated with coloniality. “Colonialism says: let’s modernize, let’s civilize, let’s humanize”. The way out is not to colonize other planets, but to know yourself.

How far have traditional critics of capitalism dared to go on the journey “into ourselves”? How much have you questioned what has been considered humanly necessary, and how much have you simply accepted the civilized historical process as if it told the story of mankind?

The heart of the criticism of anthropocentrism can be summed up in the following sentence by Krenak: “The problem is when we think that we are the only life here, to the point that, when the basis for this continuity here is not enough, we will reproduce elsewhere”. This leads me again to the denial of the limit, the inevitable end of life. Everything that begins has an end. But the anthropocentric concept of sustainability does not see an end for humanity. Even when the ecological perspective considers itself ecocentric or biocentric, it does not think about human existence within a cycle with a beginning, middle and end. It wants to bargain for the continuity of the scheme.

New minds, on the other hand, no longer want the scheme to continue. “This is what boys and girls are doing, they are telling the world that adults falsify a narrative about the world, and they don’t want to.” Mild autists have an advantage in realizing this. As a friend recently made me think, civilization created an exclusive language to think the world, a neurotypical or “normal” language, which excludes the natural diversity of ways of thinking, because this diversity is not efficient for the production of a civilizing project. It is common for people with neuroatypical mental structures to have difficulty understanding social and communication rules, as they do not seem to make any sense. We are forced to repress a part of ourselves in order to become “functional”, and this usually comes with a feeling of acting like a robot. In a way, it is exactly how anyone feels in civilization, in some degree. This only goes unnoticed when their performance is more easily accepted by society. “Normal” minds forget what it is like to think outside the box that civilization puts us, but “different” minds cannot forget, because they are terrible actors.

That is why tolerance or living with the different is not enough. An “alternation” is needed. Alternation implies knowing how to pass the ball, and also knowing when to leave, rest, stop, give up. Come back later, who knows. The majority of men who feel threatened by feminism have difficulty precisely in this point: they do not know how to lose. They believe that all the weight of a ancient oppressive structure can be dissipated with a policy of women “participation” in the same schemes that the patriarchy created, without displacing or disturbing them in any way. In other words, they believe in the “continuity of the scheme”. As if things need not to weigh for men. This would only be possible if patriarchy had not produced privileges. It is never easy to lose privileges and comforts, but sometimes it is necessary.

This should not be read as an apology for catastrophism or paralyzing pessimism, or worse, a connivance with a system of discarding people. But it’s hard not to look like a sadist when you have bad news to give. I do not intent to “tell the truth and run”. I intent to help whoever is receiving the message to be able to bear it. It takes courage to give up certain addictions. But perhaps what is holding us is of a different nature, something much more difficult to abandon.

I return to the main question here: are environmentalists willing to lose in the name of alternating with the Other? Judging by the mainstream ecological discourse, the answer would be no. I could cite an example: “I do not agree that more progress will be made by appealing to people’s hearts than to their wallets,” says ecological economist Robert Constanza, founder of the International Society for Ecological Economics, the main reference in ecological economics. It seems too romantic to say that it is precisely the heart, and not the reason, that can save us now. If it is true that human action always seeks comparative advantage, the worldview presented here has no chance. However, if it makes any sense, the economy as a whole needs to be questioned, not just the liberal economy, but our whole self-image as “rational beings”.

Eco-capitalism wants to put a price on nature in order to protect it. Eco-socialism wants collective ownership of the means of production (as a final objective) and more effective state regulation of the economy (as a more immediate objective) to protect nature. As Kollibri suggests, eco-capitalism is much easier to refute. Eco-socialism, however, is much more complex to answer. This is because, although it can be properly ecological, it is not exactly “sustainable”. How so?

The answer, for me, begins in this speech by Krenak: “In some cultures, the idea of ​​falling is within the cycle of existence. It articulates with the idea of ​​the seed, which buries itself, dies and becomes the tree and gives more seed, and fruit, and becomes seed, and buries again. Cycles”. Our Judeo-Christian culture, however, sees the fall as a problem. We do not want to fall, we are special, we are destined for a special place, where no one else dies and no one else falls. And because we don’t want to fall, we can’t be really sustainable, because we deny alternation. The life cycle includes death. We do not want the end of civilization, we want to avoid the collapse of this economic model based on cities that contemplate eternity. We want to use the techniques, knowledge, science and technology created in and for civilization to prevent the fall and build a supposedly advanced, and supposedly human, world. Instead, we should accept the consequences of an immeasurable accumulation of wrong decisions. Decisions so wrong that they can no longer be corrected. We need to learn to drop and fall. Can we do it, or is civilized power too tempting?"
"Why We're All Going to Die“Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”- John F. Kennedy

 

The only way out is through. Global society is dependent on artificially inflated energy resources—i.e. oil—that are directly leading us toward total collapse. Technology is being used to most efficiently maximize wealth of the largest corporate conglomerates at the expense of the social fabric and a living environment. The biosphere is in fact collapsing. The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

[iv] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"Thoughts on animal sentience and welfare.I think the society is pretty contradictory when it comes to animals.

Let's assume animals are not sentient. It shouldn't matter how you treat a dog anymore than it matter how you treat a dog robot. Neither experience anything, both have just been programmed to yelp when you kick them. Obviously we should just get rid if animal welfare laws and you shouldn't make any distinction between a guy killing a dog and dismantling a robot.

Let's assume animals are sentient. Well now we have pretty big responsibility for not only killing sentient animals, but treating different species completely differently (it's okay to kill livestock but god if you kill a dog you're a monster). Even if we ignore that, the pet owners who put down their old and sickly pets should probably reconsider what they are doing and leave it up to the animal wether it wants to die. Animals are capable of [suicide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_suicide) so I don't see how we have the right to decide for them.

Even when we have philosophical arguments about animal sentience and such, the fact is the way we treat animals is solely based on how intelligent we perceive them to be. Killing an primate would be a lot bigger deal than killing a cow, not to mentian a fly. This is obviously not a good and moral way to base our treatment of animals on. It's easy to imagine a super intelligent alien life who would view as as we view dogs, and have their way with us without our consent and certainly against our will, just because in their view we're that much lower a lifeform."
"Trying to justify existence.Emotionally, I favour existence over non-existence, but I'd like to be able to justify this to myself on a rational basis. Not being religious, the only factor which seems like it should have any weight in the decision is whether the experience of existence is positive or negative, overall. Assuming that the rational way to behave is to avoid negative experiences and prefer positive ones, I should choose existence if the overall experience is positive, and non-existence if it's negative. But since I can't guarantee whether the experience of existence will be positive or negative, shouldn't I favour non-existence as a rule? At least then I'll be guaranteed no negative experiences, and I won't miss positive ones, since I won't exist.

I should therefore favour ending my existence. But I don't just care about myself, I also care about other people. If I didn't exist, I wouldn't care about them, but while I do exist, the suffering of others is something which influences my decisions. Does this affect my choice? Avoiding suffering by destroying myself would do nothing to lessen the potential suffering of my fellow creatures. If minimising suffering is what I care about, I should favour existence, as at least by existing I will have the capacity to try to help reduce the suffering of others.

But wouldn't the best way of reducing the suffering of others be to kill them too? That way, they could never suffer again. Shouldn't it be my aim, if I'm serious about reducing suffering, to completely eradicate all life and all possibility of life?

But if life was eradicated, there would be nobody around to ensure it didn't arise again, and it might arise in conditions which would make suffering more likely than it is now. Perhaps robots could be built to patrol the universe and disrupt the precursors of life. But what if a completely new form of life arose which the robots weren't capable of recognising? The robots would have to be super-intelligent, in order to recognise such new life. But then, wouldn't the robots themselves be alive? Yes, but they'd be incapable of suffering. But if they were super-intelligent, wouldn't it be wrong to expect them to follow their programming, since this would be a kind of enslavement. No, they would be emotionless, so they wouldn't mind. Also, I don't care about robots. But what if the robots decided the best way to fulfil their mission was to destroy the universe, and they did so, believing that it would stay destroyed, but another universe spontaneously arose in its place, and it was full of suffering? Instead of creating emotionless killer robots, wouldn't it be easier to remove the capacity for suffering from existing lifeforms, or reduce suffering in some other way? Yes.

So this is my justification for existence. The point of existing is to try to alleviate suffering, and it's best achieved by remaining in existence and helping people (and encouraging people to help each other). (If you don't care about the suffering of others, the justification doesn't work)."
"1 - Philosophical foundations and challenges of AIHello everyone, I’m an undergraduate Philosophy student in my third year. I don’t want to explain all my biography, my desire and my beliefs, so I will get straight to the point. I need to write two important essays in english (that is not my first language, being italian) until the 20th of Dicember and, because a mix of my responsability and of an antiquate academic conception in my country, I’ve never write something so important and so “academic” during my undergrad years, expecially in another language. Because so, I’ve decided to dedicate everyday the first two hours of my study routine to the topic where I’m interested to and I’ve decided to do so following the “rules” of the deliberate practice, studying, writing and thinking acitvely on what I read and looking for constant feedbacks. The topics that I’ve choosed (that are my favourite philosophical topics overall) are the philosophies of Artificial Intelligence, of Cognitive Science and of Mind. Every Sunday I would like to report here a summary of the progress of my studies, trying to explain the basics concepts of the topics that I’ve choose based on my notes and hoping to start a debate on it with other philosophy addicted like me. I’m not an expert, I am not (yet) a Reddit assiduous frequentator, I’m not (yet) a good academic writer and I’m not a native english speaker, so keep in mind these premises when you read my posts. That said, I hope that my posts will be useful as an introduction and as a starting point for a deeper understanding of this crucial issues. 

Ps. These are firsts three books that I have planned to study.

- Artificial Intelligence: The Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intellingence, Keith Frankish and William M. Ramsey (editors)
- Cognitive Science: The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science, Keith Frankish and William M. Ramsey (editors)
- Philosophy of Mind: Philosophy of Mind, Jaegwon Kim

Introduction

The claim of this analysis is to approach the techincal field of the Artificial Intelligence from a philosophical point of view, so without programming or complex mathematical prerequisites. I’m going to be schematic and brief as much as I can, writing here my notes on this book and, for now, more questions that answers, hoping to go deeper in the following weeks thanks also to the comments and discussions. If you noted an error in my style, grammar or in the nature of what I write, please let me know and I’ll correct it as soon as I can, if I agree with your correction.

--

A definition of Artificial Intelligence is complex. I’ve tryied to do that and this is my answer:

- Artificial Intelligence is a) an inorganic agent capable of creative adaptation in different formal or informal context (obejct definition) and b) the studying of the possible implementation strategies of an inorganic intelligent agent (field definition)

Some important questions raised by the field of the Artificial Intelligence are:

- Can a machine think? What does it mean to “think”? Is it possible that exist some differences between different “thinking agent” (a moral agent, a live agent, an organic agent, an intelligent agent, etc.)? 
- Wich is the difference between a Strong AI (an Artificial Intelligence that is identical to a Biological Intelligence) and a -- - Weak AI (an Artificial Intelligence that act like a Biological Intelligence but that is not identical to that)?
- What are the metaphisical assumptions beyond the very idea of the AI? 
- What theory of mind and of psychology fit the best with the ideas at the foundation of the AI? 
- What ethical concerns are raised by the possible emergence of some AI?

1 - Core themes

Some of the most important of AI distinctions, issues, themes and controversies:

- Smart software vs cognitive modeling. Which is the best way to implement an AI, to create and intelligent software that are indipendent from the only intelligence that we know (ours) or to model this softwers on our cognitive functions? To postulate that this difference is inconsistent is to assume that Intelligence is a function indipendent from the material world and to postulate the opposite is to assume an identity between intelligence and the phisycal substratum of the box in which this intelligence is situated (our brain). 

- Symbolic AI vs Neural Nets. Is it possible to reach the AI building a software based on the manipulation of the formal symbols structure of the human thinking or do we focus our attention to the implementation of a model of our brain?

- Reasoning vs Perception. Do we have to build an AI that simulate the thinking process indipendently from the perception or is it necessary that a machine have an internal system of interpretation of the sensory stimulus? 

- How much is important that a machine have the capacity to rapresent the knowledge because we define it sensient and intelligent?

- Brain in a vat vs Embodied AI. Problem aparently solved: the claim was if is it necessary to built a machine that act intelligently but without being embodied in some perceptual system (like the Turing Machine) or if this machine have to interact with the surrounding world directly. The researches, now, are focused on the embodied AI.

- Narrow AI vs human-level intelligence. Is it possible to implement a Strong AI (that IS like the human brain) or is it only possible to built a Weak AI (that ACT intelligently, but that is different from the human intelligence)?

2 - Philosophical foundation and challenges

An important question: does an AI have to simulate the high level cognitive processes of the human brain (logic, deduction, inference, symbols manipulation, etc) or is it better to built first a bottom-up system that start to learn this processes from the lower level perceptual abilities? The first claim is the one supported by the GOFAI view (Good Old Fashon AI): they prefer the faster way, that is to model the best system of intelligence that we know, ours. The second is the one supported by the Embodied AI: we have to build an evolutionary system, starting from the creation of a basic simulation af an artificial organism and following it during its evolution.

The Turing Test was the first attempt to imagine how we can determine if a machine is intelligent or not: it postulate that we can understand if a system is intelligent or not just by an evaluation of its linguisti ability and of its behaviour. This is the behavioural-GOFAI vision of the AI. A new version of the Turin Test postulate that we have to integrate to this two criteria the ability of this machine to interact with the surrounding ambient. This is the vision of the Embodied AI.

It is a general belief that an AI could not think abductively, namely it could not generate conjections from some premises. This creative way of thinking is claimed to be one of the higher human ability, and who follow this argument think that a machine that could only follow a set of rules cannot think outside this rules and formulate new conjecture. This is the problem of relevance: a machine seem to couldn’t have an olistic approrach to reality, so that is impossible for her to understand when an information is relevant or when it is not. But what does it mean that only an embodied system could act intelligently? Is it maybe that there is a necessary relation between the body and the function?

Computational theory of mind. This theory is based on the assumption that when an agent think he follow a set of basic and atomic blocks of meaning, that are symbols that one could reproduce in an algorithmic system. Mental states, so, are just a composition of different blocks of meaning. But what is the foundation of this blocks? How can we have this language of thought? Is it based on what? Three possible answers of these questions: 1) informational theory: if a quantity of x change in the same time of a quantity of y so this two quantity are related; so if a mental state change when in brain there is a changing in the quantity of y the mental state is related to the brain changes; 2) evolutive theory: mental state are adaptation, useful to survive, and the meaning associated to these state are only evolution tricks for surviving; 3) conceptual-role semantics: the meaning of a linguistic fact is based on the social meaning associated to this fact. 

A critic to the Turing test: it is possible that someone build a Turing machine that seem to be intelligent because speak like an human, but it speek like that only because someone program it in that way. It could seem similare to the old argument of Lady Lovelace: one could program a machine to talk an human language but this machine could only follow the rules programmed by the programmer, never become conscious of the real meaning of the language that it speak (the Searle’s Chinese Room Argument say a similar thing, and I’m going to talk of that in a specific topic)

What is the relation between purpouse/intentionality/consciousness and AI? It could be that someone built a machine that have a mental state (AI)Purpose' correspondent to (Human)Purpose, relating a vast range of (AI)IntentionalMentalState' to (Human)IntentionalMentalState. Searle reject this view arguing that a Machine could only posses a sintax, not a semantic (meaning that a robot have an algoritmic language and human have a non-deterministic language?).

Difference between mechanism and rationality: beeing rational mean to act according to some (general) rules, beeing mechanic mean to act according to some instruction taht could violate the general rules. This is a reproposition of the problem of relevance: a rational beeing could understand when an information is relevant under the light of some evidences indipendently of the instruction, whereas a mechanical engine could only understand what someone told him to be relevant.

The godelian argument is very complex, but I understand something: any formal system is proved by Godel to be inconsistent or incomplete and being a mechanism based on some type of a formal system, one coud conclude that an AI is to be incomplete or inconsistent. The problem is that following this argument one could doubt the godelian theorem himself, because it is based on the thinking of another formal system, the mind of a mathematician."
"Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution.Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution. **[This was written BEFORE the Occupy movement began]**


February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"Objection to a Premise in Dennett's Theory of MindIn his reply to Searle’s *The Myth of the Computer*, Daniel Dennett writes the following on categorizing objects exclusively on their “causal powers” (Dennett expresses similar ideas in his book *The Intentional Stance*):

>Surely we all agree that anything that has all the relevant causal powers of food—it saves one from starving, sustains growth and repair, tastes good, etc.—*is* food. And anything that has all the causal powers of oxygen is oxygen. We think that you could in principle give a body an artificial brain by giving it something that duplicated *all* the brain’s *control* powers. And any creature so equipped would “have a mind” in the only sense that makes any sense: it would have a well-functioning (prosthetic) brain.

http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1982/06/24/the-myth-of-the-computer-an-exchange/

I believe that the idea that “anything that has all the causal powers of oxygen is oxygen” does not hold if we replace “oxygen” with “a conscious mind.”   The reason for this is that there is more to the identity and categorization of minds then simply outputs and causal powers. 


Note:  In the above quote, Dennett uses the term “causal power” because it is the term that Searle used in his reply.  Dennett seems to prefer the term “control powers” and so I will use that in the thought experiment below.  In context it is meant as the actions of the brain & behaviors of people. 


To highlight the significance of considering qualia on the identity of minds, consider the following thought experiment.   Suppose sometime in the future that AI programs become so sophisticated that not only can they pass the Turing test, but we can map a given individual’s brain and replicate their actions so effectively that even people that know the individual cannot distinguish between the AI and the person.  Let’s assume that robotics is also sufficiently advanced to the point that we can construct a robot that is indistinguishable from the human body and that we can put a computer running these AI programs into robots and match all of the actions and behaviors of humans.  


Now let’s assume you have been in a happy marriage for many years and have many shared experiences with your spouse.  We take your spouse and map their brain and body and build a robot/cyborg replica that is able to match the control powers of their brain and physically are indistinguishable from your spouse.  The robot even would have the memories of your spouse in its memory.  This replica is so effective at producing the responses and reactions of your spouse that you are not able to distinguish between your spouse and the robot.  Even though their external outputs are the same, would you consider the robotic replica, which matches the actions and behaviors of your spouse, as equivalent to your spouse?  Would you consider your spouse and the robot as interchangeable?  If not, then there must be something besides control powers of the brain that is significant to the identity and categorization of minds.   I posit that what is important to the identity to conscious beings is the internal subjective experience (i.e. qualia) had by the conscious individual.  For example, if your spouse died and the robot replica took their place, the fact that the entity that has the subjective experience that you identify as your spouse was not actually sharing the experiences with you would make all the difference to you.   


We could also take the thought experiment a step further and consider the case in which you yourself are mapped and replicated with a robot with an AI brain. Its causal powers would be interchangeable with your own to the point where the rest of the world could not tell you from your robotic replica.  Would you experience the same qualia or subjective experience as the replica?  If you had a conversation with your replica, would you see it through both pairs of eyes?  If not, then we can conclude that it is not you.


At this point an objection may be raised that even though we cannot identify a given individual solely by the control powers of the brain, we can identify properties or categories of objects based on behaviors or control/causal powers.  Therefore, we can also identify consciousness as a general property of objects or entities based on behaviors.   To illustrate, we can carry this argument over to non-conscious objects.  For example, let’ say we define a kitchen knife as an object that has a sharpened metal blade, a handle, and can effectively cut food.  Now we may not be able to replace my particular kitchen knife by building a replica, but we can easily produce an object that is a kitchen knife (i.e. has the property of being a kitchen knife and belongs in the category of kitchen knives) and matches all the causal powers of some particular kitchen knife (even though the specific identities of each are different).  


However, a fundamental characteristic of conscious beings is that we consider their internal perspective and experience and not merely what they do or are capable of doing.  It is important for to us to know what is going on in the minds of others regardless of how they behave.   We learn from an early age that people’s behaviors and their internal thoughts are in two distinct categories.  In adult relationships, the internal experience of others is just as important to us as how they behave.  In short, behaviors are consequences or outputs of conscious beings, but it is not consciousness itself.  Defining consciousness based on behaviors (i.e. the control powers of the brain) alone is not correct.  It is reasonable to assume that over time we will get better and better at replicating the outputs and behaviors of humans with AI.  But even if we get to the point where we are able to match the behavior of humans perfectly, this doesn’t necessarily mean we have produced internal subjective experience or qualia.

"The Possibility of Knowing Thyself: Impressions, Triangulation and why Theories aren't Subjective**Thesis** Part of the reason philosophy exist. Part of the reason philosophy developed naturally. Part of the reason philosophy continues to persist is that it answers some questions that are otherwise unanswerable. These questions take over the limits of science and art, yet we wish to talk about them. And beyond science and art, we can only talk about these subjects in a philosophical manner.

""Philosophical manner"" meaning that philosophical answers aim to answer questions about objectivity and subjectivity without trivializing either one.

One of the question is not so much a direct question but a commandment from one of western philosophy's founding member: Socrates. Socrates directed his followers to know thyself indirectly by the famous dictum: The Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living.

That is, the life you live and are living right now is not worth anything unless you examine it. Like gold in itself is worthless unless you know what properties it has. And you can only know the properties of gold by examining it.

In this post I aim to talk about the framework all humans find themselves in in this endeavor as we seek to find ourselves and make our lives worth living and how we can discover the properties that enrich our lives.
_____________________________________
**Part {1}**

You're an idea. 

Or rather an idea is essential to your being.

Try to exist without having an idea on your mind. This may arguably be possible, for example, through sleep or meditation. But other than in special circumstances, wherever you go you go with an idea on your mind.

The only way to start off defining yourself is going through the idea barrier. Without an idea you cannot exist. To prove you exist, you need an idea first.  

___________________________________

**Part {2}**

To be something is to be that. 

So whatever you are is a reference to what you are. But to make a reference to what you are you have to be something that is referenced or capable of being referenced. 

To reference means to point to something. When you're referencing yourself you're pointing at yourself.

You cannot, however, just point to yourself and find yourself. It's like saying ""A is A"". An ""A"" is worthless without knowing its properties, its relations to other letters, or how it can benefit/enrich you from using it. 

If you point at something that is you, you have to be both the subject and the object in question.

You have to be (1) something that is subjectively evaluating an objective thing and you have to be (2) an objective thing that is being referenced.

___________________________________
**Part {3}**

When we reference an apple, we first get an apple and call it an apple. Then we compare an apple to what an apple is not.

If the apple is red, then we say that the apple is red. But the apple is red because it's not any other color.

The positive and negative qualities are intimately tied. Just because the apple is not blue doesn't mean it's yellow. The apple is both red and not blue. It's not just not (any color but red). The apple is red and not (any color but red).

Why an apple is red can be explained or reasoned in many different ways:

1. We can talk about lights waves 
2. apple genetics 
3. the climate that allowed for red apples to emerge 
4. the environment that favored red apples to continue existing vs different color apples that may have gone extinct or never given a chance to flourish 
5. our vocabulary that says ""red means this particular phenomena"" and an apple that adheres to that definition (""An apple is red because red it word we use to describe the phenomena that the apple is exhibiting"")
6. Etc

Some of these truths are absolutely true no matter the context. Light waves and apple genetics may be true for everyone and everything; regardless if they can understand the concept or not. 

When it comes to vocabulary, we may transfer truths to one another using words but only if those words are grounded in truth AND we agree on the meaning of the words.

We could have a debate that seems contradictory. One side may argue that the apple is red and another that it's blue. And they may both be right if their use of the word correspond to the same phenomena. 

The important or relevant thing to take away from this is that:

1. our portal towards truth depends on our impression of the world.
2. our impression must be neutralized to reach objectivity. 
3. our impression of the world and absolute truth are indistinguishable/inseparable (our impression of everything and anything is founded/reasoned through truths that exist independent of our impressions and that in itself is a truth)
4. our impression of the world is a mixture of truth and subjectivity

We can remove our personal subjectivity in order to concentrate truth (science) or we can indulge in our subjectivity (art). This isn't relevant but your day to day life is probably a somewhat balance between the two.

_______________________________________________
**Part {4}**

To know thyself is to concentrate the truth of your subjectivity. 

Let's say you're colorblind so that an apple I call red you see as forest green. You would live with subjective truths that are based on impressions that may include:

1. It's difficult for you to distinguish between forest green plates and red apple slices laying on top of the plate
2. There are colors that other people can see that you can't
3. There's something in your body that affects the impression you have of the world that results in not seeing things other people see
4. You don't know and can't know the impression non-colorblind people have of red apples

Everything I said in the first half of **Part {3}** can be known by the colorblind person and everything I listed here can be known by the non-colorblind person.

That's because the lists are ideas commenting on truths. They are ideas that beg the question with goal of justifying them. They are ideas that presuppose a foundation for reality. But the ultimate justification is your impression. Not the actual absolute truth that exist independent of you; since its only value is your dependence of it. And your dependence of it is based on impressions.

That's why any scientific question can lead to an ad infinitum ""why"" until it's stopped by ""well that's how far science has gotten us thus far"" or ""well, that's a different field of study."" Although science is humanity's best hope to cure diseases, stabilize inequality, end suffering, and create technological advancement. This isn't criticism or lampooning science. Since each discipline/gaze/etc is limited in scope and science is no exception.

Ideas that comment on truths are called theories or hypothesis. But not all ideas comment on truths. And not all truths need to be unearthed or discovered. Some truths are self-evident. For example, our impression is self-evident and true. And yet our impression of the world begs the question because it's an idea that instinctively and instantly comments on further truth that are not self-evident. 

We can then contribute to the impression of the world through art. Or we can deduce our impression of the world through science.

Necessarily, art carries with it scientific truths that can be uncovered and at the same time scientific truths affect our perspective of our art and artistic unfolding. So even the illusion of removing subjectivity is merely an illusion.

________________________________
**Part {5}**

I'm not a dualist. I favor a threesome perspective. That is founded on triangulation.

To know yourself you first have to find yourself. And as with any mathematical problem or navigation, you need at least two knowns or two coordinates to find yourself. 

I would argue that to find and know thyself you need absolutely need two broad coordinates: Absolute Truth and you. 

The difference between the two is that while you're founded on absolute truth, absolute truth is impermeable. You're not impermeable. You're tainted by subjectivity. You are a changing thing based on the changing universe. It's true that sometimes you're cold and sometimes you're hot. Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad. You regard some things as morally good and other things as morally bad. And what those things are sometimes change and sometimes they don't. But all of it is based on absolute truth. 

Change is part of absolute truth. Everything changes constantly. Any impression of the physical world being stagnant or stationary is an illusion based on impressions. Based on truth and subjectivity. 

It's like a video game that changes maps. The buttons you press are always the same to achieve the desired results.

There may be games that change the button layout each map so that you have to re-adjust, but there is still a foundation of truth that guides the change. There's still an objective. You cannot play a game without there being an objective. Regardless if the objective is created by the game creators or yourself. To move, to think, to do requires a plane where you can triangulate yourself. Whether that's space and time or morality or a video game.

Ultimately, to know thyself is to be aware of how you define what you define. Because the part of you that is based on absolute truth is unchanging and consistent. But it's not physical. It's based on principles that transcend the physical since its properties are evident but inconsistent with how the physical behaves.

______________________________________
**Counterarguments**

On whether **Part {1}** is just Cartesian skepticism: I'm not saying that the physical world can be trivialized or that your ideas take precedence to the physical world. I'm saying that as soon as you start talking, you're bringing an idea to life. You cannot talk or think or exist without bringing an idea to life. Even if you exist without thought there's no way to know you exist because to know you exist is a thought. 

The idea itself can be like a plant that sprouts. We can investigate the origins of the plant and its makeup or we can analyze the plant itself. But you cannot start to talk without there being an idea associated. Your words and thoughts are part of the nutrients that give the plant life, among other things.

One may argue ""what if we program a robot to say 'I exist' or 'I am'"".

I think this goes back to the fundamental question of how can you know thyself.

Doing one of those fancy European philosophy moves we can see it another way. The euro step? No that's basketball. I mean the flipping something on it's head in a very French way.

Asking ""what happens if a robot says 'I exist'"" is the same thing as saying what happens when a rock says ""I exist"" or if another human says ""I exist.""

We can only know they exist insofar as we can see they exist (either artistically or scientifically). The same thing when you yourself say ""I exist."" You exist insofar as you can see yourself.

You see yourself when you express yourself. Sometimes you express yourself and only you can see the expression. Or sometimes you express yourself but only you have the perspective you have (since each person has their own perspective). Either way, you can simultaneously express yourself and see yourself since your perspective is a further expression of you. 

Although usually we express ourselves first and after a while reflect on ourselves. 

In short, we can deduce an existential being exist or not (and in what ways it exists) based on pragmatism. And that pragmatism can be led by science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two. 

Concerning ""science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two,"" we naturally combine both. Furthermore, we can't influence one part without influencing the other. But this unfolding also feeds into who you are and what you can reflect on.

It's bad philosophy to introduce a concept at the end (such as pragmatism) but moving on, your being observes the universe. Your being is indirectly observing absolute truth. And our subjectivity shines a light on different truths that depend on our subjectivity.

We can put our subjectivity aside by cancelling it out in theory and militarize pragmatism in a scientific context and discover ""objective truths"" but even without doing this, your subjectivity runs into objective truths all the time. It's just that our subjectivity measures truth less accurately than science. Although to an equally true degree. 

The only way to measure truth more accurately is through pragmatic effort, then. To DO something first and see what results. Evaluate what you see. Whether it's something artistic or scientific or if it's evaluation artistically or scientifically. To do something, anything, and then to triangulate that something with absolute truth to find yourself. Yourself being a union of the two and thus a triangulation of who you are. If we are to equate who you are with where you are. But finding where you are is the first step of finding thyself.

"Moral motivation and moral realismI originally posted this in /r/askphilosophy, but it got almost no attention there, so I'm reposting it in /r/philosophy to hopefully get a larger audience.  I mainly posted this in order to ask the questions I pose at the end, but I also give arguments in the beginning of the post, so I hope it's not against the rules.  Here it is:

I've been an ardent antirealist about morality, mainly because of Mackie's queerness argument and specifically because of the motivational branch of that argument (laid out here very broadly):

   * If there are moral facts, then they must be intrinsically motivating.

    * No fact is intrinsically motivating; only desires are.

    * Thus, there are no moral facts.

A thought experiment which I think exemplifies the force of this argument is the idea of a Malevolent Dictator Of The Universe who is essentially omnipotent and has a strong desire to torture people for fun, and he is resistant to modifying this desire for any reason due to its strength. From his perspective, there seems to be no reason not to torture people: the probability of any future retribution or rebellion befalling him is 0. There seem to be no arguments or evidence that we could possibly present to the MDOTU making the case for ""one ought not to torture"" that would motivate him even a little bit to not torture, which casts doubt on the prospects of ""one ought not to torture"" being an objective fact, assuming that moral judgements are necessarily supposed to motivate to at least some degree. I think this example is particularly troublesome for varieties of moral realism that identify morality with prudential/rational reasons for action, like the view Michael Smith develops in ""The Moral Problem"". As far as I can tell, the MDOTU is of sound mind and is acting rationally according to his desires, but we want to condemn his actions as unethical.

Shafer-Landau's discussion of motivational externalism - the position that there is no necessary connection between judging that one morally ought to X and being motivated to X - in ""Moral Realism: A Defence"" got me thinking about what types of entities we expect to be susceptible to moral motivation. There are no moral facts or moral arguments that could stop a boulder from rolling down a hill, for example, but we don't take that to be problematic for moral realism. The obvious reply is that this is because a boulder doesn't have a mind, which I completely agree with. But I don't even think that every entity with a mind capable of forming beliefs and being persuaded by rational arguments needs to feel motivated to act in accordance with its moral judgements. Consider a robot AI who has been programmed with an overriding desire to steal every TV set it sees. We might give it an argument or point to a fact that indicates that stealing is wrong, and the robot might completely assent to this, but nonetheless it is incapable of feeling motivated to not steal. Again, I don't think that we should feel that moral realism is jeopardized because of this example: regardless of the basis of moral facts and moral arguments, we shouldn't expect them to convince an AI to go against a hard-coded desire.

I'm not sure if a motivational internalist would feel compelled to respond to the AI example, depending on what variety of internalist they were. Perhaps there are some internalists who assent to ""every entity with a mind must be necessarily motivated to at least some degree by moral judgements"", but if that claim turns out to be too strong, then they can't retreat to ""any mind that wants to be motivated by moral judgements will necessarily be motivated by moral judgements"" because then the view is just tautological, so the question of where to draw the line is raised.

At any rate, the upshot is that I think that adopting something-in-the-neighborhood-of motivational externalism is the best response to the version of the queerness argument I sketched, and it also gives us a response to the Malevolent Dictator thought experiment: if we accept that there are cases where moral judgements are not intrinsically motivating, then the fact that none of our beliefs are intrinsically motivating is not a strike against realism. The fact that we cannot motivate the MDOTU is stop torturing people does not mean that torture is not unethical. (Additionally, we might helpfully point to the psychological feature of the MDOTU that makes him resistant to moral argumentation, for the sake of sketching out a more complete theory).

Granting all that, there still seems to be some conceptual connection between morality and motivation and/or reasons for action, even if it's a defeasible connection. So the project for the realist seems to be to 1) identify some collection of facts that 2) provide motivation to at least some degree to 3) some set of agents with the right mental features 4) at least some of the time. That's a lot to leave unspecified, but I think this is already a much more manageable project than ""describe acts that everyone always has a reason to do, always"" which is where many varieties of moral realism tend to go.

So my questions: am I groping towards any standard metaethical views? Does anyone have suggestions for filling in my 1-4? Should I be worried that my answers to 1-4 might be ""arbitrary""?

Thanks."
"Transhumanism - Your thoughts, emotions, fears, inhibitions? And how long will we remain human? What does it mean to BE human?Hello r/philosophy,

I'd like to take a few minutes to open a discussion regarding transhumanism, or the integration of cybernetics/technology with our own biology, and open up a venue for fellow lurkers to present viewpoints for and against it. I can't control anyone else, but I promise I'll respect your opinions as long as you respect my own.

One of the great minds on the forefront of such ideas is **Ray Kurzweil**, a futurist, author and inventor who has spent 30+ years studying a behavior coined ""*exponential growth*,"" in which technology and our understanding of it and our own biology does not statically grow from one stage to the next, but increases by exponential rates every year. Here are some thoughts of his:

>*""By 2029, we’ll have reverse engineered and modeled and simulated all the regions of the brain. And that will provide us the software/algorithmic methods to simulate you know, all of the human brains capabilities including our emotional intelligence. And computers at that time will be far more powerful than the human brain. And we’ll be able to create machines that really do have subtlety and suppleness of human intelligence. And they’ll combine that power with ways in which machines are already superior to us. They can impart us all of human knowledge with the few keystrokes, it can remember billions of things accurately. They can share knowledge in electronic speeds that are million times faster than the human language.""*

>*""...20 years, 25 years, these nanobots, these blood cell size devices will be going in our bodies keeping us healthy from inside. We’ll have some go inside our brains to the capillaries not invasively, there would be interacting with our biological neurons so it’ll extends our memory, our decision making faculties, put our brains on the internet and they also enable us to enter virtual reality environment from within the nervous system.""*

Another pioneer in the venture of Cybernetics is [Kevin Warwick](http://bigthink.com/ideas/39801), the first *human cyborg*. Professor Warwick, with artificial implants, was able to control a mechanical hand thousands of miles away by ""jacking his nervous system into the internet."" He has also done extensive research into biological-robotics, including a small robot with a ""brain."" Warwick is convinced that man must integrate with machine in order for us to survive and evolve as a species.

**Some other questions I have:**

* When will we have reached the point in which we are no longer *human*? If technology consist of tools created by humans to extend our own human abilities, how are these *not* human?

* For those of faith, do you believe it an *abomination* or an *act against God* to pursue the halting of biological death, or at least postponing it? Do you believe that we are meant to accept death as a part of life, and to attempt to stop that is, essentially, an affront against what we were ""meant"" to experience?

* When do you think AI will be created, if ever? Furthermore, what is your definition of AI? Some, like myself, would argue that we already have narrow, ""primitive"" AI within our everyday lives.

* Does the thought of SkyNet happening scare you?

* What are some possible ethical/moral laws and regulations that should be put into place as we move into the integration of cybernetics and human biology?

* I believe the most important question, though, is very simple: what does it mean to be *human*?

**TL;DR: SkyNet: Yay or nay?**

*I know that there are a lot of people that may not agree with the people/sources I've mentioned in this post, but that doesn't mean that we cannot discuss the possibilities for our coming future and the transition into technological mastery. I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of this.*

EDIT: I just realized there are already two or three threads dealing with technology and AI. I promise, I wasn't attempting to piggy-back off of these ideas."
"What is consciousness, and what does it mean to be a conscious entity?As I read more and more about the philosophical ramifications that the exponential growth of science and technology will have on humanity, I find myself thinking more and more about these questions.  Science and technology may not seem to be the subjects that would lead one to questions of consciousness, but when one reads about the exponential growth of computational technologies the bridge between the two, seemingly distinct, subjects is formed.
	We take for granted that we human beings are conscious.  Some people may extend the honor to some animals such as dolphins, some apes, blue whales, and elephants because of their family structures, advanced communication systems, and prolonged adolescent periods, but this could be explained as a product of evolution, being that homo sapiens are rather closely related to some of these organisms, but the question that I am more interested in is if entities that are not of an organic nature could be considered to be conscious.  Could an advanced computer that can think in a manner equal to that of a human mind be considered conscious?  I understand that this question is not the exact one that I posed in my title, but I feel that if we can answer one then we can answer the other.
	Consciousness is loosely defined as the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself; it is subjectivity, awareness, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood and the executive control system of the mind.  This is an adequate definition, but it leaves out the answer to one very important question: where does consciousness reside?  
	The location of one entity’s consciousness may seem like an odd question.  One may be tempted to equate it to the question of where the soul resides, but this question forces one to more clearly define what consciousness is.  
	One might say that the consciousness, like the theological or spiritual soul, resides within the heart (i.e. body) and mind, but as a material realist I find fault with this.  How can the consciousness be directly tied to one’s physical self?  By the age of twenty the majority of a person’s cells are not the same cells that he or she was born with and all of the atoms that make up his or her body, including the brain’s atoms, have been replaced many times.  Our bodies are simply a pattern.  To say that the consciousness has any connection to the physical body is to assert that there is some abstract essence that constitutes a conscious.  I find this to be a baseless assertion.  
	So this brings us to the brain.  The brain, like the body, is also a mere pattern, but it is this organ that thinks, and therefore, the consciousness, all of one’s thoughts, memories, and instincts, is a product of the brain.  This is important to note because the brain is mechanical.  Thinking is the product of electric pulses between neuron connections.  This is why it is possible to create a computer that works in the same manner as the human brain, and due to the Law of Increasing Returns this possibility will soon be a reality, so if consciousness resides in the brain why can’t a nonorganic being (i.e. a computer or “robot”) be conscious?
	The future holds more than just computers that will be equal to and quickly surpass human thinking capabilities.  In Ray Kurzweil’s book The Age of Spiritual Machines he writes about the exponential evolution of technologies, but he also writes that 

“A more challenging but also ultimately feasible scenario will be to scan someone’s brain to map the location, interconnections, and contents of the somas, axons, dendrites, presynaptic vesicles, and other neural components.  Its entire organization could then be re-created on a neural computer of sufficient capacity including the contents of its memory.”

	If this is possible, then what does it say about consciousness?  Kurzweil is talking about taking everything that is in the brain, not just the memories and the instincts, but everything, and downloading it on to a machine of some sort.  If consciousness if the culmination of one’s thoughts then this mechanical device would possess a consciousness, and if this machine also has the ability to think in a manner that allows it to carry on thought based on information gained from the brain scan would this machine not represent the continuity of the original person’s consciousness?  This question leads us to two other distinct questions.  Is life a requirement for and entity to be conscious?  Would these machines be considered alive?
	The second question that I proposed may seem radical, but Mr.Kurzweil does a splendid job of putting such a question into context.  In The Age of Spiritual Machines he writes that

 “Up until now, our morality was tied to the longevity of our hardware.  When the hardware crashed, that was it.  For many of our forebears, the hardware gradually deteriorated before it disintegrated…As we cross the divide to instantiate ourselves into our computational technology, our identity will be based on our evolving mind file.  We will be software, not hardware.
As software, our morality will no longer be dependent on the survival of the computing circuitry.  There will still be hardware and bodies, but the essence of our identity will switch to the permanence of our software.”

I know that I have posed more questions than my title implied, but I hope I was clear in my inquiry and my personal opinions.  I truly wish to hear other people’s thoughts on this subject.

"
"A Question.If we were able to create an artificial being such as a robot that was capable of emotions/pain, but not able to act upon those emotions, is it still a robot or something more?

Also, would it be morally wrong to kill/torture it?"
"What are your opinions on a technologically-advanced meritocratical anarchy?We should shape our societies so that only scientists have jobs and are paid well, so that they can reproduce more. That way, we have a society which has incredibly advanced technology and machines do everything for us from helping us sleep to getting our food to building our buildings. Therefore, investment in the industrialization of a country wouldn't be needed, as the machines would replace humans. I'm not talking being lazy and sitting around all day, despite the possibility of this happening. I'm talking about not having to worry about minor details of our lives, and move on to accomplish great things and fulfill dreams.

The point is that so we don't actually have to do any physical labor as a species and can set our minds to doing only what we want instead of what we need. Science would be revolutionized, the entertainment media would grow, and since the economy, industrial, and agricultural sectors would be controlled by machines, politics wouldn't have to side with the ""majority's view"" that we should have governmental control over the economy, our personal lives, and possibly the military. The basis of this argument is that with a technological future like such, we are capable of living together in peace in an anarchical society.

I don't see this happening within the next 50 years, but I sure do hope it happens, and we can live lives we can judge worth living simply because we can accomplish anything and are not limited by any barriers.

Solving the economical, agricultural, and industrial crisis: investing in science and robotics, having less manual human labor, and investing in efficient renewable fuels.

Who knows, we might live forever; and if the euthanasia-requirement topic comes up some time in the future, my counterpoint is that we don't have to die for others to live. We can all live infinitely, and build a unified civilization which colonizes uninhabited planets, and terraforms to sustain life.

We are stardust, aren't we? We might as well spread the dust among the stars.

"The Function of Life and Illusion of PurposeThis is my mind's rambling stream of consciousness from the other day...I'm trying to develop my own philosophy and ""spiritual"" side (not a religious connotation) so I guess I'm looking for input/ constructive criticism... a Kierkegard quote I found after this sent a shiver down my spine due to how similar it was:

 ""The thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. ... I certainly do not deny that I still recognize an imperative of knowledge and that through it one can work upon men, but it must be taken up into my life, and that is what I now recognize as the most important thing."" 
-Søren Kierkegaard

Life is a function who's input is energy(ATP being the final domino of the translation process for us humans) and who's output is (the ability to? free will? or are we just machines constrained to this loop) effectively changing the universe in novel,patterned, and constructive ways. Life reorders the madness of the universe's random chaos into illusions of purpose, for there seems to be no grand purpose other than creating one.

The resource, the energy that this whole process at a psychological level (sustinence such as food, shelter, etc. ignored), THIS EQUATION OF LIFE, requires seems to me to be a BELIEF in some pillars of reality. A healthy, genuine attachment to certain associations, most importantly the ones that derive pleasure and emotions, but there are a myriad of other vital human associations that we must keep to sustain the inertia of our being.

So I suppose by writing this I hope to find a better ""path"" to follow in order to become a happier and constructive person. I will stop intellectualizing here and try to become more observational, visceral, for a static mind is no better than a immutable, stupid robot.The 
human mind gives us the opportunity to transcend meaningless, linear tasks, and create as Dawkins calls it, an illusion of purpose, through the novel output that life is capable of.The WHYS of consciousness seem to allow this human dimension to exist. WHY asks for meaning.. Is WHY the foundation of consciousness and the illusion of purpose? I just asked what WHY means to humans because I want to know WHY the human mind functions. Meta...My mind is streamlined to find purpose. TO 
connect with otherwise meaningless matter. Is that WHY?  because... Does not being ignorant (or being comfortable with being such) lead to meaninglessness, meaning we must pick our beliefs or die, quite literally? (for apathy leads to detrimental consequences...like suicide, being the most extreme...reflecting complete apathy)"
"Why the Chinese Room Argument might not be as wrong as you think.John Searle's 1980 [""Minds, Brains, and Programs""](http://www.class.uh.edu/phil/garson/MindsBrainsandPrograms.pdf) is one of the most infamous philosophy articles in the last 40 years. It has been especially vilified on internet discussion communities, whose members were often extremely optimistic about the future of A.I. research. Unfortunately, many people who immediately dismiss Searle's argument misunderstand it. This is not to say that Searle's argument doesn't have problems, which I'd be really happy to discuss in the comments. In this post, I will lay out a really loose version of the argument Searle presented (because I don't specialize in philosophy of mind, my main goal here isn't to say anything new or brilliant but to get a discussion going on an interesting philosophical topic), and then I will discuss a reason to think it might not be as far off base as many have taken it to be.

The idea behind the Searle's article goes like this. Suppose that you are placed in a room, with a massive set of instruction manuals. Every so often, you are given a sheet of paper with some Chinese characters on it. You dutifully hunt up the characters in the instruction manual. Beside each set of Chinese characters, there is a second set of Chinese characters. You write down this second set on a fresh slip of paper, and pass that slip of paper back out of the room.

Unbeknownst to you, these instruction manuals were so well-designed that when a native Chinese speaker passes a slip of paper with any Chinese sentence into the room, using the instruction manuals, you write down and return a perfectly sensible and appropriate response. Now, what would the person on the outside of the room think? She would probably think ""Wow, the person I keep exchanging notes with speaks Chinese very well!"" But, do you *actually* speak (understand) Chinese? No, you just got really good at using the instruction manuals.

Searle's next step is to ask ""If the person in the room doesn't understand Chinese, what makes you think a computer can? After all, both are just rearranging symbols without an idea of what any of the symbols *mean*.""

Now, Searle's original paper was aimed at showing that computer programs don't get intentionality for free. But, if intentionality is necessary for consciousness, it is a short step to argue that computers don't get consciousness for free either. That is, even if a computer were behaviorally indistinguishable from a human, that does not necessarily mean that the computer is conscious.

Importantly, this is a thought experiment, so you shouldn't worry too deeply about how complex or large the instruction manuals would have to be or how long it would take to look up the symbols or those kinds of things. You can just imagine that the person in the Chinese room has an amazing device that slows down time while she hunts up symbols in the instruction manuals. (If you still worry, keep in mind that this is supposed to be an analogy to how computer programs work, and that some brute-force style translation programs do work roughly in this way).

There have been many, many, many replies to Searle. He mentions several in his article (like the ""Systems reply"" - that the person in the room doesn't understand Chinese, but the *system* of the room understands Chinese). We can discuss some of those replies in the comments, but I'd like to introduce a potential reason for thinking that Searle was roughly on the right track.

Imagine that some future computer programmers have become so skilled that they create a computer program that (when run) is indistinguishable from a regular human. The only way anyone could ever realize that it wasn't a human would be by taking the computer apart and seeing all the hardware inside. Finally, suppose (for the sake of argument) that this computer / computer program actually is conscious. Call this the type 1 program.

Now, do you think those same programmers could be skilled enough to design a program that had the exact same behavior, but used completely different functions or methods, such that when the program is run, it *isn't* conscious? That is, could they use their (now quite impressive) programming skills to purposefully design a program whose output was exactly like the type 1 program, but that wasn't conscious? My intuition is that they could. (Robot p-zombies, oh my! Call this the type-2 program).

If you share that intuition, then there are some interesting questions to ask. What is the difference between the two programs? Are the types of programs we build more like type 1 or type 2 programs? If you don't share that intuition, why not? Do you think that programmers could never get good enough to build such a program?

My claim is that if you share the intuition that (ideal, future) programmers could build the type 2 program, then Searle is right in claiming that symbol manipulation / data processing that leads to behavior that is indistinguishable from humans' is not, in itself, sufficient for consciousness.

"The Meaning Of Life: My Analysis And ThoughtsThis is a question that has been asked since humans first became  conscious intelligent beings. It is arguably the most powerful question  in philosophy, and the one that is most often associated with it. There  have been many different answers to this question throughout history.  Different philosophers, scientists and historians have all attempted to  give their unique spin to the question “what is the meaning of life?”.  In today’s post, I am going to examine some of these ideas, break down  the question into smaller pieces, and articulate my own response to this  philosophical inquiry.

**Before we begin this journey, we must first define two important and relevant terms; the concepts “life” and “meaning”.**  

Let’s first look at three definitions for the word “life”:

1. The condition that distinguishes animals and plants  from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,  functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2. The existence of an individual human being or animal.
3. The period between the birth and death of a living thing, especially a human being.

Let’s now look at three definitions for the word “meaning”:

1. What is meant by a concept?
2. What is the significance of a concept?
3. What is the important or worthwhile quality of a concept?

**Now that we have defined both concepts, let’s break things down even further.**

When we are asking “what is the meaning of life?”, we are essentially asking the following 3 questions:

1. What is life?
2. What is life’s significance?
3. How does one live life in the best possible manner?

After having answered these questions, we will be able to synthesize  all of our ideas and create a response to the question that is the  subject of this article.

**What is life?**

As mentioned earlier, life is the condition that distinguishes  animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for  growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change  preceding death.

**Let’s dive deeper into some of these properties.**

1. Organization. Living things are highly organized,  meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living  organisms are made up of one or more cells, which are considered the  fundamental units of life.
2. Metabolism. Living things must use  energy and consume nutrients to carry out the chemical reactions that  sustain life, such as growing, reproducing and maintain the structure of  their bodies.
3. Homeostasis. The maintenance of a stable internal  environment, even in the face of a changing external environment, is  known as homeostasis.
4. Growth. Living organisms undergo regulated growth.
5. Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce themselves to create new organisms.
6. Response: Living organisms show “irritability,” meaning that they respond to stimuli or changes in their environment.
7. Evolution:  Populations of living organisms can undergo evolution, meaning that the  genetic makeup of a population may change over time.

While understanding this list of properties will not greatly affect  our day-to-day framework of how we think and live our lives, it is still  important to know the difference between a living organism and  non-living entity.

**The next question one might have is, how did life begin?**

Many scientists believe that chemical reactions led to RNA, which was  the first molecule on Earth to self-replicate and begin the process of  evolution that led to more advanced forms of life, including human  beings.

**Now that we know how life began in general, let’s examine how life began for human beings.**

Humans evolved from a species known as Homo erectus. Furthermore,  humans share a common ancestor with chimpanzees. For most of our species  history, we were not the dominant force we are today; we were somewhere  in the middle of the animal food chain. Everything changed during the  cognitive revolution that occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago.

We discovered fire, created tools, and developed language. The most  important thing we did was create and connect around ideas that do not  physically exist, such as religion, politics and capitalism. This level  of imagination and consciousness is something that no other living  entity possesses. It is thanks to the cognitive revolution that we are  the dominant, intelligent and conscious beings that we know ourselves to  be today, and it is thanks to our consciousness that we are able to ask  questions such as “what is the meaning of life?”.

**Another big question that we have is the question of how the Universe started.**

The Big Bang theory is the most commonly accepted response to this.

* The Big Band theory is the prevailing cosmological model  explaining the existence of the observable universe form the earliest  known period through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model  describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high  density and temperature.

In recent years, another theory called String theory has gotten quite popular.

* In String theory, the multiverse is a hypothetical group of  multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that  exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and  the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different  universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”, “other  universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”.

We now understand what characteristics separate living organisms from  inorganic matter, how life began, how humans evolved, and why humans  are different from other living organisms. Furthermore, we are able to  somewhat understand what the Universe is and how it started.

**However, we are still left with many questions.**

Are we special? Are we the only intelligent and conscious entities in  the universe or in the multiverse? Is anything “real”, or are we living  in a simulation? Does God exist? Is there life after death? How do all  of the complexities of the Universe work? Is there a deeper purpose to  life or are we merely just bodies of carbon living in a world that is  random and that does not care about us?

Unfortunately, these questions have no objective answers to them. The  deeper we dig, the more questions we have. Science can only answer so  much. There is only so much we can understand about life, about  existence and about the Universe. String theory says that there are 11  dimensions. Humans are only equipped to experience and understand 4 of  those dimensions. With that being said, the progress that we have made  in the last few hundred years has been remarkable. With every year that  passes, we understand a little bit more about the Universe and about  ourselves.

We are curious beings and we are wired to want to explore, to ask  questions, and to try to find answers to the mysteries of the world.

**What is life’s significance?**

As mentioned, we will never know whether we are merely just bodies of  carbon living in a vast apathetic and random Universe, or whether there  is a deeper purpose to our lives and to our existence. With that being  said, life is still meaningful and significant, and the best way to  figure how is to analyze how we are wired as human beings.

Similar to how machines and robots are wired to think and behave in  certain ways, human beings are wired to want and desire certain things.  If there is one thing I want to emphasize in this section, it’s that  while technology and culture have progressed drastically over the last  100 years, we still have the same desires that we had thousands of years  ago and we have not changed much biologically over that time span. The  only difference between today and two thousand years ago is that we are  now satisfying our desires and needs in newer and more complex ways.

**Physical survival.**

Survival is the deepest and most important instinct that we have. As  mentioned earlier in this article, for most of our specie’s history we  were somewhere in the middle of the animal food chain. Without good  health and a good environment, life is difficult and filled with  suffering. No baby is born ready to give up and commit suicide. It takes  a process full of corruption and suffering for a human being to get to  that point. Humans and animals are wired to want to live. As Abraham  Maslow points out in his hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety  needs are the foundation of his pyramid.

While physical survival used to be the act of running from a tiger or  getting shelter in a cave, physical survival today in the western world  is eating healthy, making money, investing, going to the gym, attaining  influence and power, sleeping well, etc.

**Reproduction.**

Reproduction is survival in a different form; survival of our genes  and of our specie. We are wired to want to procreate. Evolution made the  act of sex enjoyable. Our desire for reproduction has not changed.  What’s changed is that as a result of newer technologies, safety and  security, and world dominance, people realize that taking care of  children is a time-consuming lifestyle and choose to focus on their  other needs and goals first, keeping their desire for children as  something to explore later in their lives. Thanks to technological  advancements such as birth control and abortion, people have more  control over their lives and are able to enjoy the benefits of sex  without its consequences.

**Belongingness and Love.**

Humans beings are social animals. We are not meant to live in  isolation. In large part, the way we learn, understand ourselves and the  world, maintain our health and sanity, and think about and solve  problems is by communicating and cooperating with others. There is a  concept that is known as Dunbar’s number. It is essentially a claim that  humans can maintain no more than 150 friendships and connections at a  time. Yuval Noah Harari’s talks about this in detail in his book  “Sapiens”.

Yuval went on to explain that the reason we are able to cooperate in  large groups and dominate the world despite our cognitive limit to the  number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships,  is because of our ability to connect around shares beliefs, such as  stoicism, Christianity, capitalism, money, etc. This shows just how  important connecting with others is for us. In fact, our ability to  communicate and connect with others is one of the biggest reasons how we  went from being in the middle of the animal food chain to the civilized  and dominant people we are today.  

In connection with this desire to connect with others, we are also  wired to want to love and to be loved. Love is crucial for a child’s development. Without adequate love at  an early age during sensitive and critical periods, children develop  attachment issues that can affect them for the rest of their lives. This  shows just how crucial love is for us. Even when we grow up and become  teenagers and adults, we are still yearning for belongingness and love.  It might be something as simple as having anxiety in high school because  we don’t feel as though we have good friends. It might be the  experience of being depressed because a close family member passed away  and we regret not having told them how much we love them. It might be  throwing a fun surprise birthday party for a best friend or sibling  because of how much we cherish them.

Our desire and need to love and to be loved shows itself in numerous  ways throughout our lives. Christopher McCandless wrote this before his  death, “Happiness only real when shared”. This was coming from a man who  had escaped humanity his whole life and who lived his final days in  isolation in the wilderness. Despite pushing people away his entire  life, McCandless realized moments before his death that our lives are  meaningless if we are not surrounded by loved ones.

Another important form of love is self-love. At the end of day, the  only person that will be there with us at every moment of our lives is  ourselves. It is therefore crucial to have a good relationship with  ourselves. If we can’t love ourselves then how can we expect others to  love us? Ayn Rand put this idea beautifully with this quote, “To say ‘I  love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.”

**Curiosity.**

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Europe with  three ships. The explorer and navigator who completed four voyages  across the Atlantic Ocean is known today as one of the most important  figures in history, opening the way for widespread European exploration  and the colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first  European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Christopher Columbus, as well as the thousands of others throughout  history who put their lives at risk for the sake of curiosity and  exploration, did so because they did not want humanity to be forever  bounded by geography and ignorance. The Apollo Lunar Module Eagle  landing on the moon on July 20, 1969 is another example of humankind  attempting to expend its horizons. History is filled with pioneers and  giants from all fields; people like Socrates, Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da  Vinci, Martin Luther King Jr, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,  etc.

Going out of our comfort zones, taking risks, being creative,  expending our horizons, being curious, asking questions, trying new  things, and exploring the earth and space is something that is deeply  ingrained in us. Our desire to explore and to be curious is something  that sets us apart from all other living organisms; it’s what makes us  unique.

Curiosity doesn’t always have to lead to world-changing events like  stepping on the moon or discovering America. Sometimes, curiosity can be  something as simple as sitting down and writing a paper on a topic we  find interesting. Curiosity can be the experience of taking a vacation  and visiting countries and cultures we have never seen. Curiosity can be  the decision to indulge in good habits and to stick to them despite the  discomfort they may cause at first. Curiosity can be the process of  starting a business on an idea we are passionate about. Curiosity is all  around us, and it is one of the most primal instincts that we have.  Let’s embrace our curiosity and our desire for exploration, and let’s  create lives that we will be proud of.  

**Legacy.**

As mentioned earlier, one of the instincts that motivates us the  instinct for survival. We have already talked about two forms of  survival in this article; physical survival and the survival of our  genes and of our specie. There is a third form of survival that controls  much of what we do in life; spiritual survival. Immortality is a desire  that is primal to us. We have the gift of consciousness, but also its  curse. We are the only living organism that is able to imagine and think  about its own death. We don’t want to die. It’s in our nature to desire  survival. For that reason, we try to stay healthy and to physically  survive for as long as can.

However, physical survival is often not enough. We understand  consciously that there will come a time when our bodies will no longer  be able to function. We understand that we will physically die one day.  For that reason, some people turn to religion and God and believe that  if they live a life following certain commandments and behaving in  certain ways, then they will go to heaven and live for eternity. Others  understand that the afterlife is something that we don’t fully  understand. Is there an afterlife? What happens after death? Despite  physical death, will our spirits and souls live on?

These are all pertinent questions. I have the view that there are  certain things that we can’t control. We can’t control what happens to  us after we die. We can control, however, what we do in this life. We  are not guaranteed the promise of heaven. For that reason, we must turn  our attention to building the best legacy we can. Perhaps our name will  be able to live on for generations. Perhaps the value that we will have  given to humankind will play a role in immortalizing our spirit. Perhaps  the legacy we desire is what we leave behind to our children, to our  family, and to our loved ones.

There is a reason that we still remember the names of some of  history’s greatest and most ambitious. There is a reason we still  remember Socrates, his Socratic method of questioning and the honor he  showed in the face of death. There is a reason we still remember Julius  Caesar, the empire he built, and how his empire played a large role in  the development of modern government. There is a reason we remember  Galileo, why we call him the father of observational astronomy, why we  call him the father of the scientific method, and how he stood up for  his beliefs and was a contrarian at a time when going against the grain  could get one killed. There is a reason we will remember Elon Musk long  after he is dead, and his contributions to electric vehicles, space  travel, and clean energy.

The desire for legacy is a great one; there is a lot of meaning that  can be found in its pursuit. The desire for prestige, for  accomplishment, for competition, and for status are some of the most  primal desires that we have. Abraham Maslow, the prominent psychologist  includes esteem needs and self-actualisation as part of his hierarchy of  needs.

It’s important to understand that only a few will be able to have  their names and work immortalized for centuries. Let’s not let that  derail us. It is not the final product that counts. It is the process of  working on something that is greater than ourselves that is of  paramount significance here. In order to build a great legacy, it is  important to help others, to provide value, and to try to push humanity  forward.

Some people will argue that the desire to work towards a great legacy  is stupid. They will argue that one day humans will go extinct and that  when this happens, nobody will know Galileo, Napoleon, Einstein, or  whoever else we want to name. This is a strong logical argument. The  reason I disagree with this view, however, is that logic is not always  the most important factor in an argument. If there’s one thing I want to  make clear in this article, it’s the important of meaning and of  purpose. Where is the meaning in nihilism? Where is the purpose in  believing that we are insignificant and that our lives will mean nothing  millions of years from now?

Despite the fact that these statements may both be logically correct,  what we are trying to articulate in this article is a framework that  will be helpful in our day-to-day lives. A desire for legacy is not only  deeply wired in us, but it is also honorable to want to better  ourselves and to want to better the world. It is honorable to want to  leave behind a piece of who we are, whether in the form of family, in  the form writing, in the form of art, in the form of inventions, in the  form of exploration, or in whatever other medium we choose.

**Acquiring knowledge and transferring it to future generations.**  

If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s the importance of  protecting our species’ knowledge and successfully transferring it  across generations. This goes back to our desire for survival, and more  specifically our desire for the survival of our species. If we do not  safeguard our knowledge, then how can we make sure that the human  species will progress? How can we make sure that we will learn from  history and not commit mistakes that we have committed in the past? We  can’t. It is why books have always been valuable.

Walking in a library is one of the most surreal things that one can  experience. In a library, we have the ability to read from the greatest  minds of human history; Plato, Aristotle, Albert Einstein, Stephen  Hawking, Will Durant, etc. We have more books and more wisdom than can  last a lifetime. Furthermore, our brain is a muscle and it must be  trained. If we spend our days mindlessly scrolling social media and not  putting our brain to use, then we will develop mental problems later in  life and we will not have fulfilled even an ounce of the potential that  we have.

It is our duty to acquire knowledge, to learn as much as we can, and  to put this knowledge into practice. Despite having books and wisdom  from some of the greatest thinkers of all time, our world and our  societies still face many problems. Every era has its own unique set of  problems, and it is our responsibility to learn as much as we can and to  turn our knowledge into practical action. Furthermore, it is our  responsibility transfer our species’ and our personal knowledge to our  kids and future generations so that they will be well equipped to deal  with the challenges of their time.

**Well-being.**

If there is one thing that almost all religions, philosophies, and  schools of thought have in common, it’s that they aim to reduce  suffering and increase well-being.

* Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and  prosperity. It includes having good mental health, high life  satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to manage  stress.

The desires to reduce stress, and to experience happiness and  prosperity are fundamental to who we are. Throughout much of our  species’ history, we experienced wars, diseases, natural catastrophes,  etc. Christopher Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author  wrote the following, “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely  at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history”. This  is a fascinating statistic.

As mentioned earlier, our desires for competition and status, and our  instinct to separate into groups are all part of what makes us human.  Despite all the good that has come from those desires, there has also  been a lot of suffering that has resulted from them. The world can  sometimes be a cruel place filled with evil. It is for this reason that  so many religions and philosophies have attempting to figure out ways in  which we can reduce suffering.

A large part of well-being has to do with health. Gut health, for  example, is strongly correlated with mental health. It is for this  reason that people who have gut problems suffer in life satisfaction. To  be happy, healthy, and to prosper are goals that everyone has. A big  part of making progress towards those goals is combining a lot of the  things that have already talked about in prior sections of this article.  Are we living healthy lives? Are we constantly trying to learn more and  expend our horizons? Do we feel loved and are we surrounded by people  who cherish us? Are we working on our legacies and on projects that  excite us, or are we wasting our time and potential?

Happiness is not something that should be chased. The more we chase  happiness, the more miserable we will be. There is a great book about  this topic called “The Language of Emotions”. It’s important for us to  understand that all emotions are equally important, and that each  emotion serves its own unique purpose. Anger, for example, allows us to  create boundaries. Sadness allows us to release energy. Fear lets us  know when we are in danger. We need to allow happiness to come as a  by-product of a life well-lived, and when it does come, we need let it  be free like a bird; it will come and go when it pleases.

Contentment is a far better thing to aim for. When we are content, we  are grateful for everything that we have. With that being said, we  still try to get a little bit better every day. Mindfulness is also  important. In today’s world of over-stimulation, instant gratification,  and constant comparison, it is easy for us to spend much of our time  either stressing about the future or being depressed about the past.  It’s important to take a step back, to be grateful, and to ask ourselves  what we can do today to better our lives and to create good habits.

Finally, we need to understand that well-being is something that is  unique to each of us. What motivates me and makes me happy, might be  different than what motivates you and makes you happy. It is our  responsibility to have self-awareness, to understand ourselves, and to  understand what drives us.

**How does one live life in the best possible manner?**

Let’s look at what some famous thinkers, philosophies, religions, and schools of thought have said about this.

**Stoicism.**

* Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in  Athens in the early 3rd c entury BC. It is a philosophy of personal  ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural  world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to meaning  and happiness is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,  by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or  by the fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to  do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating  others fairly and justly.

Stoicism was the primary philosophy during the time of the Roman  Empire. The beautiful thing about Stoicism is that arguably the two most  famous Stoics in history came from completely opposing situations and  classes; Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a man who was born  a slave. Despite their complete opposing life situations, both Marcus  Aurelius and Epictetus wrote and talked about all of the same Stoic  virtues. In recent years, Stoicism has had a resurgence. Marcus  Aurelius’ journal “Meditations” is now one of the most famous books in  the world. Furthermore, books from modern writers such as Ryan Holiday  have brought Stoicism into the mainstream.

**Existentialism.**

* Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores  the problem of human existence and centers on the lived experience of  the thinking, feeling, acting individual. In the view of the  existentialist, the individual’s starting point has been called “the  existential angst,” a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or  anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.  Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the  meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were some of the first and most important existentialists.

* Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is  that existence precedes essence, which means that individuals shape  themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived  categories, an “essence”. The actual life of the individuals is what  constitutes what could be called their “true essence” instead of an  arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings,  through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a  meaning to their life.

**Epicureanism.**

* Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BC  based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.  Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable  pleasure in the form of tranquility and freedom from fear, and the  absence of bodily pain through knowledge of the workings of the world  and limiting desires.
* Epicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life.  Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest  amount of pleasure possible during one’s lifetime yet doing so  moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in  such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than  on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially  produced desires were to be suppressed.

**Objectivism.**

* Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by  Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in  her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged  (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books. Rand described  Objectivism as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own  happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement  as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”.

I read a large portion of the book “The Fountainhead” about a year  ago and I enjoyed it. This is one of the passages that has stuck with  me.

* “It is not in the nature of man–nor of any living entity–to start out by  giving up, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that  requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man.  Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run  down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or  how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their  elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning  one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’s values; practicality, of  losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that  fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and  reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek  a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.”

The reason I like this passage so much is because it communicates in  very clear and poetic terms the idea that a desire for meaning and that a  desire for improvement and greatness are core elements of who we are.

**Logotherapy.**

* Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor  Frankl. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the  belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most  powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to  this system is given in Frankl’s most famous book, Man’s Search for  Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his  Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and  reinforced his theories.
* According to Frankl, “We can discover this meaning in life in  three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by  experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude  we take toward unavoidable suffering” and that “everything can be taken  from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose  one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.

**My Thoughts.**

As can be seen, there exists many great schools of thoughts and  philosophies. What almost all of them have in common is the emphasis  they place on pursuing meaning. We live in a world filled with instant  gratification, overstimulation, misinformation, censorship, anxiety and  fearmongering. Furthermore, we live in a world and in an environment  that pedestalizes short-term harmful pleasure and makes it difficult to  delay gratification and pursue meaningful projects and activities. It is  our duty as individuals to take responsibility for our lives, to work  to better ourselves in incremental fashion, to work to better the world,  to try to enjoy the process of life, to love ourselves, and to pursue  meaning rather than short-term detrimental pleasure.

As mentioned earlier in his article, the are many existential and  philosophical questions that we are not able to answer. Perhaps with the  advancement of science we will one day be able to better comprehend the  complexities of the Universe. However, for the time being, we must  focus on what we can control as individuals and create frameworks for  thinking and living that are helpful for our development.

I believe that a large part of the meaning of life is to live  according to our instincts; maintaining good health, being surrounded by  people we love, working on our legacies, acquiring knowledge,  transferring our knowledge across generations, procreating, and placing  great importance on our well-being. However, it’s important to also  understand that we are not chained by our instincts. Each of us have  something special in us that gives us the ability to think and to be  creative. This ability to be flexible, to explore, to try new things, to  learn from great thinkers and philosophers, to go outside of our  comfort zones, to take risk, to go against the grain, to be contrarians,  to be creative, to think outside the box, and to constantly ask  questions and find solutions is what makes us special.

Going back to Viktor Frankl, one of my favorite quotes is the  following, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that  space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our  growth and our freedom.”

I want to emphasize once more that there is meaning in life and that  this meaning can be found all around us. We sometimes see people who  have fallen into nihilism. As someone who once fell into nihilism,  perhaps I can shed some light on my experience and on why nihilism can  be appealing.

* Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that  nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with  extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

The reason I fell into nihilism was because I was going through a  difficult time in my life. I had just moved cities and schools, and I  had left behind all of my childhood friends and almost everything that  was a constant in my life. This happened when I was a young teenager and  it was the worst experience of my life. At the time, I struggled  greatly with understanding my emotions and with social anxiety. It took  many months for me to finally come to terms with my situation and to get  out of denial. For a long time, I tried to convince myself that my  situation was okay and that everything would be alright. I struggled  with anxiety, with depression, and with many more problems.

With that being said, the story has a happy ending; I got closure and  I now live a life where I am generally happy and motivated. My point  with this entire story is that sometimes our life experiences lead us to  philosophies that serve as defence mechanisms. Nihilism, as well as the  belief that free will does not exist, allowed me to tell myself, “life  is meaningless, and I have no control over my situation”. Nihilism was  an escape. The rose-coloured glasses that I had been so accustomed to  wearing had turned into dark-coloured glasses. I was seeing the world  through a completely different lens. When we feel that there is no  meaning in life, it’s probably because something has gone terribly wrong  in our lives.

Of course, this is not always the case. There are plenty of nihilists  out there that believe in nihilism because they believe it to be the  most logical framework for understanding the world. However, as  mentioned earlier in this article, logic is not the only way to go about  looking for truth and examining topics such as the meaning of life;  emotions and instincts are sometimes just as important. An obsession  with logic leads to skepticism. David Hume demonstrated this with “the  problem of induction”. The problem of induction essentially explains  that nothing in the Universe can be proven for certainty. The problem of  induction, as mind-boggling as it is, demonstrates that the odds of the  sun rising tomorrow are equal to the odds of the sun not rising  tomorrow. That is the problem when we put logic on a pedestal and don’t  consider other important factors.

Nihilism is not natural because it looks at the world through a  pessimistic and defeatist lens, which is antithetical to how we are  wired and to who we are as human beings. No baby is born a nihilist.  Going back to Ayn Rand’s quote, “It is not in the nature of man–nor of  any living entity–to start out by giving up, by spitting in one’s own  face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose  rapidity differs from man to man.”

With closure, with life experiences, with the process of slowly  improving, with information on how to deal with grief, and with  knowledge on life and existence, I went from being a nihilist to the  person I am today, the person I have always truly been; someone who  looks at the world with a glass half-full, someone who looks at the  world with curiosity, wonder and love, and someone who believes in  meaning, pursues meaning, and lives a life of meaning.

To further emphasize my point that life has meaning, and that  striving for meaning is natural and a core part of who we are, let’s  look at the science. Psychologist Jordan Peterson talks about the  orienting reflex in many of his lectures online. He explains that our  brain produces a very complex internal model of the world, and that our  senses produce a model of the external world. The hippocampus watches  those two models to see if they match, and if they don’t match, then a  mismatch signal is created; the orienting reflex.

* The orienting reflex is an organism’s immediate response to a  change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to  elicit the startle reflex. The orienting reflex is a reaction to novel  or significant stimuli.

The orienting reflex essentially serves as a compass of meaning for  us; it is an instrument that guides us through life. It is one of the  deepest instincts that we have. The best way to articulate this point is  by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, M. J. DeMarco:

* “Your soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced  with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or  during a massage. How are you responding to your soul’s voice? Is it  denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work?  Distracted by a television? Honored?”

When we are wasting time and when we are indulging in behaviours and  activities that lack meaning, that are unnatural, and that are  antithetical to growth, our orienting reflex will let us know. It is our  responsibility to listen to our voice, to accept the mistakes that  we’ve made, and to take steps towards the right direction. Life is  filled with meaning. We must open our eyes and we must embrace this  meaning. Meaning is a core part of who we are, and we must live in  accordance to the instincts and purposes that have been explained and  analyzed in this article. Furthermore, we must also not follow  philosophies and ideas blindly and dogmatically, and we must understand  that the journey of life and the journey of meaning is unique to each of  us.

This article was a collection of thoughts from some of the greatest  thinkers of all time, as well as my own thoughts and my attempt to  synthesize all of this information. It is worth noting that someone  might read this article and not agree with everything. That is okay, and  it is completely normal. Each of us are at a different stage in our  process of life, and we come from different environments and have  different genetics. Despite the objective nature of some of these ideas,  the way I view life and the way you view life will not always be the  same. Two of the most important skills one can have are self-awareness  and critical thinking. If we are able to understand ourselves and our  thought process, and if we are able to question ourselves and to  question the world, then we have what it takes to grow as human beings  and to tackle difficult questions such as “what is the meaning of life?

Best of luck my fellow readers. Please feel free to reach out to me to ask any questions or to discuss some of these ideas!"

Here are blurbs for each of the Spring 2017 AMA Philosophers:

**Amie L. Thomasson**

[I am](http://thomasson0.wixsite.com/amie-thomasson) a Professor of Philosophy and Cooper Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Miami, soon to be moving to take up a post as Professor of Philosophy at Dartmouth. Lately I have been working largely on questions about the proper value, functions, and methods of metaphysics. I also work on metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of art, philosophy of social and cultural objects, and phenomenology. Earlier in my career I worked a lot on fictional characters, and a lot of my graduate training was in phenomenology. I have published more than 60 articles and three books: [*Fiction and Metaphysics*](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/philosophy/epistemology-and-metaphysics/fiction-and-metaphysics?format=PB) (Cambridge University Press, 1999), [*Ordinary Objects*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ordinary-objects-9780199764440?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2007) and [*Ontology Made Easy*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ontology-made-easy-9780199385119?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2015).

**Samantha Brennan**

[Samantha Brennan](http://samjaneb.tumblr.com/) is a Professor in the Department of Women's Studies and Feminist Research at Western University, Canada. She is also a member of the Rotman Institute of Philosophy and a member of the graduate faculty of the Departments of Philosophy and Political Science. Brennan's main research interests lie in the area of contemporary normative ethics, particularly at the intersection of deontological and consequentialist moral theories. She also has active research interests in feminist ethics.

She is author of over 20 articles and chapters, as well as co-editor of eight books. Brennan is also the co-founder and co-editor of [*Feminist Philosophy Quarterly*](http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/fpq/), an online open access journal in feminist philosophy. She's an active blogger who used to write a lot at the feminist philosophers blog but now mostly posts at [Fit is a Feminist Issue](https://fitisafeministissue.com/), a blog she started with her friend and colleague [Tracy Isaacs](http://tracyisaacs1.tumblr.com/).

**Chris W. Surprenant**

[Chris W. Surprenant](http://chriswsurprenant.com/) is an associate professor of [philosophy at the University of New Orleans](http://www.uno.edu/cola/philosophy/), where I am the founding director of the [Alexis de Tocqueville Project](http://www.uno.edu/tocqueville-project/), an academic center for research and programming focusing on issues at the intersection of ethics, individual freedom, and the law. His work is at the intersection of moral and political philosophy, and his current projects apply this knowledge to contemporary issues in criminal justice reform, including the ethics of punishment; explore the connection between human well-being and entrepreneurship; and examine the influence of the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers on Kant's moral and political philosophy. He has received a handful of awards for his academic work. They include being recognized by Princeton Review in 2012 as one of the ""Best 300 Professors"" in the United States, and by Cengage Learning as one of their ""Most Valuable Professors"" of 2014, awarded to three professors in the United States who ""have made lasting impressions on the education and lives of their students.""

**S. Matthew Liao** 

[I am](http://www.smatthewliao.com/) a philosopher interested in a wide range of issues including ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, moral psychology, and bioethics.

I am also the Editor-in-Chief of the [*Journal of Moral Philosophy*](http://www.brill.com/journal-moral-philosophy), a peer­-reviewed international journal of moral, political and legal philosophy.

**David Chalmers**

I'm a philosopher at NYU and ANU.  I'm interested in consciousness:
e.g. the [hard problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf)
(see also [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_chalmers_how_do_you_explain_consciousness) TED
talk), the [science of
consciousness](http://consc.net/papers/scicon.pdf), [zombies](http://consc.net/zombies.html), and [panpsychism](http://consc.net/papers/panpsychism.pdf).  Lately I've been thinking a lot about the philosophy of technology: e.g. the [extended mind](http://consc.net/papers/extended.html) (another [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksasPjrYFTg)), the [singularity](http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf), and
especially the [universe
as a simulation](http://consc.net/papers/matrix.pdf) and [virtual reality](http://consc.net/papers/virtual.pdf).  I
have a sideline in metaphilosophy: e.g. [philosophical progress](http://consc.net/papers/progress.pdf), [verbal disputes](http://consc.net/papers/verbal.pdf), and [philosophers' beliefs](http://consc.net/papers/survey.pd).
I help run [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org) and other
online resources.  Here's my [website](http://consc.net/chalmers) (it was cutting edge in
1995) and here's my [life story](http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/david-chalmers/).

**Lisa Bortolotti**

[I am](http://www.lisabortolotti.com/) Professor of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham. I studied Philosophy in my hometown, Bologna, before completing masters at King’s College London and the University of Oxford. I got my PhD from the Australian National University in Canberra. After a research position in Manchester, where I worked primarily on ethical issues emerging from the biomedical sciences, I joined the Philosophy Department at Birmingham. I was awarded the American Philosophical Association Book Prize for [*Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/delusions-and-other-irrational-beliefs-9780199206162?cc=us&lang=en&) (OUP 2009). My latest book is [*Irrationality*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745647839.html) (Polity 2014).

My research interests are in empirically-informed philosophy of mind. I am especially interested in the strengths and limitations of human cognition and my work focuses on some familiar and some more unsettling instances of inaccurate or irrational belief, including cases of prejudice and superstition, self-deception, optimism bias, delusion, confabulation, and memory distortion. I am currently leading a five-year project funded by the European Research Council on [*Pragmatic and Epistemic Role of Factually Erroneous Cognitions and Thoughts* (PERFECT)](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/perfect.aspx), where I ask whether beliefs that are false or irrational can have benefits in terms of bringing about some dimension of success or even furthering agents’ epistemic goals. I argue for the view that there is no qualitative gap between the irrationality of those beliefs that are regarded as symptoms of mental health issues and the irrationality of everyday beliefs. I hope my research and that of my team will contribute to undermining the stigma commonly associated with mental health issues.

In the blog I founded in 2013, [*Imperfect Cognitions*](http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/), academic experts at all career stages and experts by experience discuss belief, emotion, rationality, mental health, and much more.

**Shannon Vallor**

[Shannon Vallor](http://www.shannonvallor.net/) is the William J. Rewak, S.J. Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley. Her areas of specialization are the philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and the ethics of emerging technologies. She is President of the Society for Philosophy and Technology, an executive board member of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, and the 2015 winner of the World Technology Award in Ethics.

Her current research focuses on the impact of emerging technologies, particularly those involving automation, on the moral and intellectual habits, skills and virtues of human beings - our character. Her work investigates how human character is being transformed by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, new social media, surveillance and biomedical technologies, and appears in journals such as *Ethics and Information Technology*, *Philosophy and Technology*, and *Techné*, as well as a 2016 book from Oxford University Press: [*Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=us&lang=en&).

**L.A. Paul**

Some experiences change what you know and understand. In this way, these experiences change you. Some change you so dramatically and so profoundly that they change who you are in some deep and life-altering way. Such experiences transform you. In my recent book, [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), I develop this idea and use it to argue that we can’t rationally control and plan our lives in the way we ordinarily think we can. The idea, at a deeper level, is about the metaphysical structure of the self, and how we can form and construct ourselves through life-changing experiences over time. I’m deeply interested in the nature of transformative experience and what it implies for the rationality of big life decisions, authenticity, and the nature of the self. Related questions I’m working on now include: What is the mind doing when it is disoriented in time? Is it rational to choose to have a chip implanted in my brain and gain a new sense modality? What is the modal and psychological structure of self-deception? How is fear of transformation involved in the fear of having new ideas? What can first person shooter-style computer games and virtual reality experiences teach us about the nature of the immersed self?  

I’m a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. I’m also a Professorial Fellow of the Arche ì Research Centre at the University of St Andrews. My main research interests are in metaphysics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind. I focus my writing on the nature of the self, temporal experience, causation, causal experience, time and time’s arrow, perception, mereology, constitution, and essence. My latest book is [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), published by Oxford University Press in 2014. You can learn more about my research and read or listen to various discussions of it in the New Yorker, The Guardian, The New York Times, the BBC, NPR, and other venues at [www.lapaul.org](http://www.lapaul.org/).

**Jay L. Garfield**

[Jay L Garfield](https://jaygarfield.org/) is Doris Silbert Professor in the Humanities and Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Buddhist Studies at Smith College, Visiting Professor of Buddhist Philosophy at Harvard Divinity School, Professor of Philosophy at Melbourne University and Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at the Central University of Tibetan Studies.  Prof Garfield’s research addresses topics in the foundations of cognitive science and the philosophy of mind; the history of Indian philosophy during the colonial period; topics in ethics, epistemology and the philosophy of logic; methodology in cross-cultural interpretation; and topics in Buddhist philosophy, particularly Indo-Tibetan Madhyamaka and Yogācāra.  

Prof Garfield’s most recent books are [*Minds Without Fear: Philosophy in the Indian Renaissance*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/minds-without-fear-9780190457594?cc=us&lang=en&) (with Nalini Bhushan, 2017), [*Dignāga’s Investigation of the Percept: A Philosophical Legacy in India and Tibet*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dignagas-investigation-of-the-percept-9780190623708?cc=us&lang=en&) (with Douglas Duckworth, David Eckel, John Powers, Yeshes Thabkhas and Sonam Thakchöe, 2016), [*Engaging Buddhism: Why it Matters to Philosophy*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/engaging-buddhism-9780190204341?cc=us&lang=en&) (2015), [*Moonpaths: Ethics and Emptiness*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/moonpaths-9780190260507?cc=us&lang=en&) (with the Cowherds, 2015) and (edited, with Jan Westerhoff), [*Madhyamaka and Yogācāra: Allies or Rivals?*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/madhyamaka-and-yogacara-9780190231286?cc=us&lang=en&) (2015), all published by OUP. Garfield is current working on a book with Yasuo Deguchi, Graham Priest and Robert Sharf, *What Can’t Be Said: Paradox and Contradiction in East Asian Philosophy*; a book on Hume’s *Treatise*, *The Concealed Operations of Custom: Hume’s Treatise from the Inside Out*; and a large collaborative project on Geluk-Sakya epistemological debates in 15th-18th century Tibet following on Taktshang Lotsawa’s *18 Great Contradictions in the Thought of Tsongkhapa* and research with Shaun Nichols on the on the impact of religious ideology on attitudes towards death.


**Kenny Easwaran**

My main work is on formal epistemology and decision theory, with some particular interests in the epistemology of mathematics, and understanding the use of mathematics in describing the world (and particularly in describing our beliefs and decisions).

I started my undergraduate career at Stanford interested in math and music, but after a philosophy of science class and some logic classes, I decided to add philosophy. For my PhD, I attended UC Berkeley's program in Logic and the Methodology of Science, which gave me flexibility to continue advanced mathematical study while preparing for a career in philosophy (though I initially thought I was going to do the opposite). After getting my PhD in 2008, I spent two semesters as a postdoc at the Australian National University, and started a tenure track job at the University of Southern California. In 2014, as my partner was searching for tenure track jobs (he works on nanomaterials for solar energy), we managed to find positions for both of us at Texas A&M University, where I now have tenure.

Most of my work focuses on issues in probability and decision theory, and particularly paradoxes that arise with infinity. One might think that the finitude of our minds means we can only ever consider finitely many possibilities when reasoning about the world. But there are in fact infinitely many ways things could be, and we can implicitly reason about them through our use of language and mathematics, and we never have sufficient information to narrow things down to a finite list of possibilities, unless we ignore the distinctions we can talk about.

I'm happy to answer questions about anything I've worked on, or anything else that sounds interesting. If you want to read some of my work, you can find it all on my website:

"How do you define if something or someone is human ??The question is clear..  

Do you think that a set of cells can be defined as human?  (i.e. 5 days old fetus (which is identical to frog fetus?)

Do you think appearance, intelligence  and motor skills can be defined as human ? (think of humanoid robots in 100 years and battle star galactica?)

Well, i am an engineer not a philosopher , but i thought only this subreddit may help me.

**Edit:** I recently understand you refer to ""human"" as ""homo sapiens"" in philosophy. I do not ask how do you define homo sapiens ..  So please , please do not refer to DNA any more 


**Edit2:** because of confusion let me ask differently :  what are the minimum requirements of something or someone that can be considered human thus should be respected and accounted noble as human ?

**Edit3:** Religions, biology, law all have some point of view in definiton of human.. I know those views and don't care because i think most of all have missing something. I am seeking a deeper answer so i am not in /r/biology .

"Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution.Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution. **[This was written BEFORE the Occupy movement began]**


February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"My friend and I exchange philosophical epistles to stay in touch.This one is ""On Evil""I’ve decided to write to you today, to discuss something that has been weighing quite heavily on my mind. I won’t pretend to be doing so with selfless motives; I enjoy this sort of talk, and I always jump at the chance to hone my writing abilities.

Since I have just spoken of “honing my writing abilities”, I will not allow myself an irresponsibly decorated introduction.

I am writing to you, dear friend, to discuss the Argument of Evil, and while I am well aware that you know the details of this argument, I will still summarize it in my own colloquial words. 

The world is full of murderers, rapists, liars, and villains of all sorts. Innocent children are murdered every year. People experience sorrow and pain of unfathomable intensity on a daily basis all throughout the world, and throughout the history of life itself. 
If someone COULD prevent such horror, especially at no cost to themselves, they would have the highest moral obligation to do so.  If someone cannot prevent these tragedies, then that person is not omnipotent.
If a god exists, then he is either impotent or evil.

This is the basic argument you will hear brought against the notion of god(or at least a benevolent god). My intention in this letter is not to defend the argument from evil, but rather to express my dissatisfaction with the best theological objections to it. 

It is so easy to allow emotion to commandeer ones faculties, and cause one to forsake clarity of thought, so I will try my best to avoid this perennial pitfall.

In my younger years, I never gave this argument much credit. I could dismiss it easily in a number of ways. As I aged, and I became exposed to the philosophies of academic Christians, my arsenal of responses to the problem of evil steadily increased. For the sake of convenience I will list the most common responses to the problem of evil below.

1.) Bad things happen to allow good things to come of them. I.E. ""When God closes one door he opens another"".

2.) God works in mysterious ways. (""We can't possibly understand why God does the things he does so let's just assume they are good"") This relates to the first argument but is slightly different.

3.) Bad things happen to remind us that we are sinful and must worship God. (""God made 9-11 happen to punish America for sinfulness"") A famous accusation of the late and not great Jerry Falwell.

- This next one is far and above the most sophisticated-

4.) God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

- The first argument can be discarded merely because of it’s blatant appeal to the future, and the third can be ignored because of its downright barbarism, as well as its inconsistency(Since it would require all non-Christian countries to suffer God’s wrath). 

The second and the fourth, however, have some value. 

The 2nd argument is obviously an appeal to ignorance, and yet I will give it a proper response because of it’s frequent use by noted apologists. I read an essay by the eminent Christian philosopher William Lane Craig on the problem of evil, and after suffering through his trademark wordiness, I saw that he was unable to avoid this appeal to ignorance.

He explain that as “finite, limited beings” we cannot possibly fathom the timeless, infinite God of the universe.

Forget, for a moment, how irritating this common religious response is, and look at it through the lense of your greatest ally; Reason. 

In general, the Christian responses to the argument from evil are always arguments of unavoidable victory. This means that they frame things in such a way so that if something good happens, it is God’s doing. However when something terrible happens, it is attributed to the mystery of God, or perhaps even the mischief of Old Nick. Victory is unavoidable.

This sort of thought reminds me of a passage from Voltaire’s Candide, which I will provide below.

“You see,” said Candide to Martin, “that crime is sometimes punished; that rascal of a Dutch captain met the fate he deserved.”
“Yes”, said Martin, “but was it necessary that the passengers on his ship should perish also? God punished that knave, the devil drowned the others”

Voltaire, with his merciless wit, rightly mocks this sort of childish thought. The idea that all good things are attributed to God, and all bad things find ownership elsewhere, is embarrassingly transparent and should not be given a second thought by the intellectually honest thinker.
 
We now move on to the most compelling rebuttal to the argument from evil, the 4th argument.

God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

I first heard this argument put forth by prominent Cambridge mathematician and apologist John Lennox. Lennox has been referred to as the “closest thing to a modern C.S. Lewis”, and is a rare example of a respected Christian Scientist( A Christian who is a scientist, not the outrageous hallucinations of Mary Baker Eddy). He used the 4th argument in a debate with Christopher Hitchens, and I felt as though his argument was not properly scrutinized. Here is the link to their debate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH68Y5MUGfo

The reason Lennox’s argument went uncontested is because Hitchen’s actually shares this belief. In Hitchens' book Letters to a Young Contrarian, he attacks the idea of universal accord, and states that disagreement is what makes life worth living. He explains how dull and meaningless a world would be where there is no contrary thought or competing ideas. Hitchens didn’t think to contest Lennox’s argument because he holds the same belief. This, I believe, caused him to miss the problem with Lennox’s idea.

If you haven’t seen the glaring contradiction in Lennox’s argument yet, I will not delay any longer in revealing it to you. 

Lennox claims that a world without any pain, or any disagreement, would be a robotic world in which love, peace, and happiness mean nothing. That without their opposites they have no definition. The problem is that the Christian doctrine idealizes this very type of world in the concept of heaven. Christians yearn for an Eternal Paradise where there is no sorrow or suffering. They “take no thought for the morrow” because Christ will undoubtedly return in their lifetimes. To Christians, this life is simply passing scenery on the path to paradise. The core Christian belief in heaven directly contradicts the 4th argument. 

I happen to agree that a Nirvana of this sort is as inconceivable as it is undesirable. A place where all people share the same opinions, and dissension is nowhere to be found, is not a place that I would want to exist in even if it were a possibility. It would be robotic, unconscious, and inhuman.

The problem for Christians is that the Bible does not agree with this sentiment, and so the 4th argument cannot be used by those Bible believing Christians who so love to use it.

The notion of heaven is the key to dismantling the 4th argument.

I am an agnostic who is quite friendly to the idea of Deism, and so I am not entirely convinced by the argument of evil. I look forward to hearing your thoughts dear friend, and I hope they will bring some clarity to this most difficult topic. 

Warmest regards to you and your family.

"Civilization is the original cause of ecocideI recently read a text called [It’s Not Capitalism that’s Driving Ecocide; it’s Civilization](https://macskamoksha.com/2019/12/not-capitalism), written by Kollibri terre Sonnenblume, and I decided to write something about it. I agree that it is not only capitalism that is driving ecocide and that colonialist society has been doing this since long before. By the title, some people may think that he is saying that capitalism is not a problem, which would be wrong since the text states that “capitalism cannot be reformed and must be dismantled”.

The central point of the text should be read as a question: is it possible to reconcile Marxism and environmentalism? Although eco-socialists guarantee it is, there are some complications to be solved, especially when considering concepts such as “human supremacy”, or anthropocentrism. And with that I am not saying that movements like Earth First are more coherent. I am not in a position to make this assessment.

The problem is that much of ecology and socialism is anthropocentric. Most ecologists and eco-socialists do not criticize civilization. Part of eco-anarchism understands this criticism because it has opened up to other ecological perspectives. The State also cannot be reformed and must be dismantled. The ecological crisis makes capitalism even more contradictory, but the civilizing contradiction has been present since the foundation of class society: the opposition between human beings and other beings.

The question is: how far can eco-socialism go in its critique of the human domain over nature? To reflect on this, we can start by thinking about the [words](https://www.correio24horas.com.br/noticia/nid/vida-sustentavel-e-vaidade-pessoal-diz-ailton-krenak/) of Ailton Krenak : “I put in question whether there is anything possible to think of as sustainable in the urban and modern way of life that we share in various places (…). What activity can be sustainable within such a system? ”

If civilization started ecocide long before capitalism, how can the end of capitalism itself put an end to ecocide? Is a socialist, ecological and sustainable civilization possible?

Continuing with Krenak’s reflection, “food production is certainly not sustainable”. The agricultural revolution (also called the Neolithic revolution) is considered a major advance in human history, as well as the green revolution (use of new technologies to increase agricultural production, starting in the 1960s). But both were disastrous for nature and human life. Biotechnology represents a next step in the same direction, while agroecology promises to reverse the devastating effects of these “revolutions”, turning agriculture into a sustainable practice.

But let us consider sustainability as a myth, or “as a narrative that was created by corporations to continue winning over consumers with the idea that what you are consuming is produced in a sustainable way, but it is a lie”. In this sense, how to know if agroecology is really sustainable?

Even with the most ecological agriculture in the world, it is possible that “the numbers don’t match”, as Krenak says. This is because the needs we have now do not correspond to the naturally sustainable needs for human beings. These are needs created by civilization, which would never be possible without a way of life based on patriarchy, exploitation, accumulation, expansion, invasion, slavery, genocide, epistemicide and ecocide. If in fact “the infrastructure that exists in cities is going to collapse” and “all the attempts in the world to regulate consumption, production, distribution of goods are unsustainable”, what to do?

Well, we know what not to do. We cannot continue to assume the same premises that it is enough to end the waste generated by capitalism, or invest in scientific and technological advances that aim at the common good (of humanity) instead of the profit of companies. This may still be insufficient. Technology gives us extraordinary powers. Can we use all these great powers produced by our techno-scientific “advancement” for the good of all species and the planet as a whole? Is this humanly possible? Is this possible without anthropocentrism or human exceptionalism?

It is necessary to understand that “we are making wrong choices”. Not just capitalists, but we have all been making the wrong choices for a long, long time. Can we assume all the responsibility that comes with the powers granted by technological development? Environmentalists in general do not criticize the technology or the urban way of life itself. On the contrary, they are talking about sustainable cities and green technology. But what if an urban and technological way of life is actually a “trap”, something inherently unsustainable?

Krenak’s proposal is a human society that leaves no trace of its passage through the land. “We leave too much trace and every culture that leaves a trace is unsustainable.” The heart of this idea, for me, goes unnoticed by most people: that we are only passing through here. Not only us as individuals, but humanity as a whole is only here temporarily. That is, humanity needs to have an end. Civilization is, in many ways, the denial of an end. Our culture didn’t lose it’s way, it didn’t become unsustainable due to change in it’s course. It has been unsustainable since the beginning.

We are alienated “in relation to the origin of everything we eat, drink, wear”. But we are also alienated in relation to disposal, that is, the final destination of everything we eat, drink, dress, and even our own final destination. Our way of life, our consumption and our very existence has become unsustainable. That is why trying to be individually “more sustainable” is a “personal vanity”. We won’t change anything if we don’t change everything.

The idea that you can save the planet by doing your part creates “a psychological environment that hides the real reason” of the ecological crisis. The way we are living, in a more fundamental sense than just the economic system, is the cause of the ecological crisis. But we are led to believe that there is no other way to live, since we are in the most “advanced” way, and since we cannot “go back” or “revert time”.

There are other ways to live, but as Krenak says, some of them are “racist and elitist, they suggest that the rich are the ones who know how to live in the world”. This phrase can be reinterpreted in several ways: they suggest that whites are the ones who know how to live in the world. Or the people who created the industrial revolution. Or the people who have created empires. They are the people who created a way of life based on the intensive use of animals and soil. You see? Civilization invented class and poverty.

Can we prevent industrial processes from draining our water? In other words, can we prevent civilization from destroying the world? To cite one of the most difficult problems: how to abandon the use of fossil fuel? As Krenak says, “fossil fuel should have been abandoned in the 1990s”. We knew we had to stop, but we didn’t. Why is it going to be different now?

The hope for a sustainable civilization holds a belief, a modern mythology, which is the “idea of ​​self-sufficiency” of humanity. We believe that everything is possible if we strive. A better system is enough. “With the advancement of what has been called civilization, and with the advent of globalization, this thinking has taken over the entire planet,” says Krenak. Civilization has always tried to be sustainable, and it has always failed to do so. I repeat: why would it be different in a post-capitalist civilization?

The urban experience took us away from nature. The simplicity of this phrase is misleading. Being away from nature is not just not knowing how to live without a refrigerator and a stove. It means, first of all, not remembering WHO you are and what you are doing HERE. “Many values ​​that we have, that we think are fundamental to humanity, have been created and have been instilled in our culture, in our mentality”. They are not values ​​of humanity, they are values ​​of a culture that denies humanity, because it denies nature. Just as it denies life, because it denies death.

This “memory loss” is a central concept. When the poet says “people are not bad, they are just lost”, he reflects an ancestral idea. When someone happened to do something wrong, the other members of the community would come together to REMEMBER that person of the good things they did, that is, make them remember WHO THEY ARE.

Thus, the central question for criticizing ecocide is not: “how to be sustainable”, but “who are we?”, or even, “what is the human being?”. It doesn’t seem like a very pragmatic question, you can protest that we need more action and less philosophy. However, adherence to this silent and unquestioned philosophy of civilization is what brought us to this nightmare.

That is why I consider it so important that Krenak decides to talk about “worldview”, and more specifically, the worldview that “the Earth is a living organism”. This should not be interpreted as a metaphor. It is not about treating the Earth “as if” it were a living organism. If the Earth is really a living organism, everything that civilization has understood about the world is wrong, because all civilized knowledge is based on the objectification of the natural world.

Global warming is just Earth’s fever. It is not the disease itself, but a symptom. Traditional environmentalists focus on treating the symptom, but how to treat the disease? How to diagnose the disease?

The human being is able to survive if left naked in the forest, but is not capable of causing much damage to the environment. To destroy its habitat, it is necessary to create special tools and techniques for this, which have nothing to do with the need for survival. The cultures that did not create these devices “are not engaged in planetary consumption”. If these peoples are the “medicine”, in Krenak’s words, who or what is the disease? As he says, “there are people left outside this civilizing circle who still know, still reflect on a worldview, are protected by this memory and are still capable of thinking other worlds and building other world perspectives”. This suggests that we, civilized, like those who have forgotten who they are, are stuck in a single way of thinking and building the world. Our vision is restricted. The weight of the technical system that we created to change the world as we see fit can be impossible to carry, unsustainable in a deeper sense of the word.

Civilizing techno-culture “is fascinating”, but also “a poison”. “Everyone becomes dependent on this great embrace of the world for apparent human needs.” It is an addiction, as Kollibri also says. Now imagine how difficult it is to get rid of a collective addiction that has dominated us for thousands of years… Of course it seems utopian. But at the same time, nothing could be more unrealistic than staying in that addiction. As it should be clear, the greatest damage of this addiction is not exactly to the Earth, but to the human spirit. In the same way, he who weighs heavily on the life of his own family does more damage to his own self-esteem than to his family.

We have not been able to remove this burden from our conscience. We are experiencing a “dissociation” between human experience and the planet. However, we do not destroy the world without knowing what we are doing. We use all our intelligence in this project. Necrocivilization, to make a parallel with necrocapitalism, placed us in a simulated world, in which we like to be. It makes us pretend that everything is going to be okay, when it obviously isn’t. Obviously the damage we do to the world cannot be simply erased. Like a lie that has been kept at all costs, the consequences of admitting the truth are now necessarily disastrous for us.

“We were converted to an idea of ​​humanity that is not real. It is a post-humanity ”, says Krenak. The humanity that we try to realize cannot come true. The attempt to realize this ideal, running over others, is the civilizing process, “it is the core of colonial thought”. The concepts of civilization and humanity that we use are impregnated with coloniality. “Colonialism says: let’s modernize, let’s civilize, let’s humanize”. The way out is not to colonize other planets, but to know yourself.

How far have traditional critics of capitalism dared to go on the journey “into ourselves”? How much have you questioned what has been considered humanly necessary, and how much have you simply accepted the civilized historical process as if it told the story of mankind?

The heart of the criticism of anthropocentrism can be summed up in the following sentence by Krenak: “The problem is when we think that we are the only life here, to the point that, when the basis for this continuity here is not enough, we will reproduce elsewhere”. This leads me again to the denial of the limit, the inevitable end of life. Everything that begins has an end. But the anthropocentric concept of sustainability does not see an end for humanity. Even when the ecological perspective considers itself ecocentric or biocentric, it does not think about human existence within a cycle with a beginning, middle and end. It wants to bargain for the continuity of the scheme.

New minds, on the other hand, no longer want the scheme to continue. “This is what boys and girls are doing, they are telling the world that adults falsify a narrative about the world, and they don’t want to.” Mild autists have an advantage in realizing this. As a friend recently made me think, civilization created an exclusive language to think the world, a neurotypical or “normal” language, which excludes the natural diversity of ways of thinking, because this diversity is not efficient for the production of a civilizing project. It is common for people with neuroatypical mental structures to have difficulty understanding social and communication rules, as they do not seem to make any sense. We are forced to repress a part of ourselves in order to become “functional”, and this usually comes with a feeling of acting like a robot. In a way, it is exactly how anyone feels in civilization, in some degree. This only goes unnoticed when their performance is more easily accepted by society. “Normal” minds forget what it is like to think outside the box that civilization puts us, but “different” minds cannot forget, because they are terrible actors.

That is why tolerance or living with the different is not enough. An “alternation” is needed. Alternation implies knowing how to pass the ball, and also knowing when to leave, rest, stop, give up. Come back later, who knows. The majority of men who feel threatened by feminism have difficulty precisely in this point: they do not know how to lose. They believe that all the weight of a ancient oppressive structure can be dissipated with a policy of women “participation” in the same schemes that the patriarchy created, without displacing or disturbing them in any way. In other words, they believe in the “continuity of the scheme”. As if things need not to weigh for men. This would only be possible if patriarchy had not produced privileges. It is never easy to lose privileges and comforts, but sometimes it is necessary.

This should not be read as an apology for catastrophism or paralyzing pessimism, or worse, a connivance with a system of discarding people. But it’s hard not to look like a sadist when you have bad news to give. I do not intent to “tell the truth and run”. I intent to help whoever is receiving the message to be able to bear it. It takes courage to give up certain addictions. But perhaps what is holding us is of a different nature, something much more difficult to abandon.

I return to the main question here: are environmentalists willing to lose in the name of alternating with the Other? Judging by the mainstream ecological discourse, the answer would be no. I could cite an example: “I do not agree that more progress will be made by appealing to people’s hearts than to their wallets,” says ecological economist Robert Constanza, founder of the International Society for Ecological Economics, the main reference in ecological economics. It seems too romantic to say that it is precisely the heart, and not the reason, that can save us now. If it is true that human action always seeks comparative advantage, the worldview presented here has no chance. However, if it makes any sense, the economy as a whole needs to be questioned, not just the liberal economy, but our whole self-image as “rational beings”.

Eco-capitalism wants to put a price on nature in order to protect it. Eco-socialism wants collective ownership of the means of production (as a final objective) and more effective state regulation of the economy (as a more immediate objective) to protect nature. As Kollibri suggests, eco-capitalism is much easier to refute. Eco-socialism, however, is much more complex to answer. This is because, although it can be properly ecological, it is not exactly “sustainable”. How so?

The answer, for me, begins in this speech by Krenak: “In some cultures, the idea of ​​falling is within the cycle of existence. It articulates with the idea of ​​the seed, which buries itself, dies and becomes the tree and gives more seed, and fruit, and becomes seed, and buries again. Cycles”. Our Judeo-Christian culture, however, sees the fall as a problem. We do not want to fall, we are special, we are destined for a special place, where no one else dies and no one else falls. And because we don’t want to fall, we can’t be really sustainable, because we deny alternation. The life cycle includes death. We do not want the end of civilization, we want to avoid the collapse of this economic model based on cities that contemplate eternity. We want to use the techniques, knowledge, science and technology created in and for civilization to prevent the fall and build a supposedly advanced, and supposedly human, world. Instead, we should accept the consequences of an immeasurable accumulation of wrong decisions. Decisions so wrong that they can no longer be corrected. We need to learn to drop and fall. Can we do it, or is civilized power too tempting?"
"A Human Brain is not a ComputerIt troubles me that a lot of modern thinkers believe that the human brain is a computer. It has become part of the zeitgeist that we are going to achieve true artificial intelligence otherwise known as Strong AI and that the computer will become self aware like man is. But I believe that this thinking is partly due to the current limited knowledge we have of how the brain really operates as ,the limits to our understanding of artificial intelligence as well as the lack of a precise mathematical language to properly describe the mechanics of our own consciousness. 

But from what we do currently know about computation we can say that it all depends of definite rules. A computer program is governed by these rules. A computer as such cannot move beyond the rules that govern it. If we consider creativity to be a human trait. And if we consider this creativity to be indeed an act of creating something new from nothing, then we can deduce that no program can be written to produce creative artefacts. Think of a novel as an example. If the ideas and stories in that novel are truly new, then no computer program can be written to produce it. As a computer program has to rely on rules that will determine the structure of a novel.

Another objection I have against the idea of Strong AI, is that advocates dismiss the homunculus agent of our minds. This is how we perceive the world, through a first person experience that drives our desires expresses our thoughts and basically conducts an internal dialogue within us. To know how Strong AI advocates view an AI robot, try to mute out your internal thoughts and guide yourself by only what you see and by reasoning outputs. You will not be able to. The AI advocates respond that the first person experience is an illusion. Yet no human being can experience himself without this experience. And it is this experience who is the creative author of our lives. He produces creative ideas. He produces the will in us. At the same time, no investigation of computers have been able to produce a place where such an illusion can exist within it. A computer is thus a turing machine that operates mechanically without this first person experience.

I believe that given that experience if we want to model a human being as a computer, we will have to model him as a system consisting of a Turing Machine and a programmer who is programming this Turing machine. The programmer is the first person experience and is not a program or a Turing Machine. This all reduces to this system to a Human being and not a computer. A computer doesn’t have this first person programmer and cannot produce it on its own.

But because of the lack of a mathematical language that describes consciousness thinkers are able to speculate about he brain being a computer with no way of knowing for sure unless they try to build one. And even if they fail they will believe that they need a more powerful computer. It is only when we have a precise language to describe consciousness that we will truly be able to distinguish between Man and Machine.

"The Meaning of LifeHi. This is my first reddit post, so please let me know if I should change my formatting or add something.

Edit: After reading the comments, I improved and replaced some of the faulty logic in the post. 

This post will address the meaning of life. First, it is important to address the significance of this topic. Humans always try to do things to improve themselves, humanity, or the universe. It is vital that they work toward the correct goal. If the meaning of life is determined, humans can work toward something beneficial. Currently, this is not necessarily the case. People work to further seemingly important goals that do not look at the larger scale. Some people argue that humans are no better off with technology than they were without it. Many people believe the right state of mind is far more important than material things. Overall, humanity needs an overlying goal to work toward.

There are a few common answers that I have seen to the question of life’s meaning and purpose. I will address a few and my stance on them. 

First, the point of view that life has no meaning and is pointless. This view is inherently meaningless. If life has no meaning, there is nothing that humanity can do to improve itself or the universe. Even if it is correct, the conclusion would have no value. Additionally, I, along with most people, enjoy my life, which seems to suggest value in life.

Second, the point of view that each person should create their own meaning. This view seems completely flawed. If everyone can create their own meaning and each is correct, there would be many contradictions. For example, if one person’s meaning is to kill everyone on the planet and another’s is to preserve the lives of all people, they directly clash and cannot both be correct

Finally, the view that I support is that the meaning of life is happiness. I refer to happiness as any feeling that makes someone feel good, whether joy, peace, love, or other pleasure. Supporting this meaning:

-Humans are essentially extremely complex robots with many moving parts. What we feel and think is a result of molecular interactions. 

-Not all lives are the same. Some people have better lives than others. To think otherwise would be to believe that humanity can never improve; every life is the same. 

-Whether a life is good or bad depends on what that person feels and thinks. A life is simply the sum of their emotions/thoughts.

-The above three points lead to the conclusion that the only reasonable goal for humanity, if it is to improve, would be to attain an overall better life- meaning improved emotions. Whether there is or is not a perfect life, humanity can and should strive to improve their “happiness”. Once again, our thoughts and emotions are the only thing that make up our lives, so the only logical meaning of life is to optimize them.

The conclusion made above, if true, brings up a few interesting points. First, are only humans included in this meaning? What about animals? Humans are always evolving and changing. What even makes a human? The fact that it is difficult to even define the boundaries of what makes a human leads to the conclusion that humans are not the only organisms included in this meaning. However, what would constitute an organism that is part of this meaning? Maybe they would need to be able to self-reflect; maybe they would need imagination. Whatever the constraints, however, humans will almost certainly eventually be able to engineer organisms to attain this meaning, having the optimal balance of emotion. Would the optimal world be one where small organisms are genetically engineered to be in a state of constant euphoria, then reproduced massively? Would the universe be better if filled with these instead of humans?

I would appreciate any comments on if any of my logic is flawed, as well as new ideas. Thank you for reading this."
"Why We're All Going to Die“Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”- John F. Kennedy

 

The only way out is through. Global society is dependent on artificially inflated energy resources—i.e. oil—that are directly leading us toward total collapse. Technology is being used to most efficiently maximize wealth of the largest corporate conglomerates at the expense of the social fabric and a living environment. The biosphere is in fact collapsing. The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

[iv] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"The positive aspects of life are instrumental and do not add value beyond their ability to mitigate the negative aspects of lifeFor many people, happiness in itself adds value to life, and happy lives are thus inherently valuable. Indeed, if you ask a crowd what the purpose of their life is, happiness would not be an uncommon answer. However, I don't believe this is the correct interpretation of happiness (along with pleasure, contentment, joy, and all of the various positives that are pursued to some extent by humans everywhere). The value of happiness is not objectively set in stone, but depends on *what people want*. On an individual level, to value something is to have a preference for it over other similar things, and the inverse is true of disvaluing something. If we examine how preferences work, it becomes clear that no amount of happiness can create additional value above and beyond simply the lack of frustrated preferences.

&nbsp;

If I have a preference for shrimp scampi, and I eat it for dinner later tonight, that preference will have been satisfied. The satisfaction of this preference is a positive thing, and feels good when it happens. But suppose I were being spied on over dinner by my neighbor, who simply does not have any preference for shrimp scampi whatsoever. If preference satisfaction adds value compared to the 'baseline' of not having any frustrated preferences, we should expect my neighbor to envy my situation; if only he wanted shrimp scampi, he could be having it right now! 

&nbsp;

Worse yet, think of all the multitudes of dishes he lacks a preference for. Suppose my neighbor is a picky eater, and has no preference for baba ganoush, spanikopita, sushi, or foie gras. He should be overwhelmed with misery for not wanting those things, since he is unable to experience the sensation of eating them after wanting them! Yet, this is not how it works. Not wanting something doesn't put him at a disadvantage compared to somebody who wants it and subsequently gets it.

&nbsp;

[NOTE: it may appear that I am mistaken, and it's possible to envy someone enjoying a dish of food they clearly love; but in that case, the object of my neighbor's preference wouldn't be the dish itself, but the *experience of eating something one finds delicious*. That being established, we could just modify the thought experiment so that he does not have such a preference (which is odd, but not logically impossible), and the objection disappears.]

&nbsp;

My thesis is that all values work this way. All of them can be reduced to preferences that are either satisfied or not. When they are satisfied, your situation inches closer to the baseline of having no frustrated preferences. When they are not, your situation slides away from the baseline. There is no ""higher"" than the baseline, no additional benefit to having more and more satisfied preferences, compared to not having those preferences to begin with. This can be demonstrated via proof by contradiction:


i. (Assumption) Having a preference and then satisfying it is more valuable than never having it.

ii. If having a preference and then satisfying it is valuable, it is something we should want to do.

iii. Something we should want to do is the object of a preference that can either be satisfied or not.

iv. The preference to *have a preference and then satisfy it* is more valuable than never having it.

v. If having a preference and then satisfying it is valuable, it is something we should want to do.

iv. ...

&nbsp;

It's an endless loop. There is no way to justify the value of having satisfied preferences over lack of preferences without invoking further preferences, themselves also in need of justification compared to their absence. My interpretation does not fall into this pit of recursion.

&nbsp;

So, on the topic of life and its purpose, this analysis implies that happiness is not an end in itself, but only a means to the end of getting rid of your frustrated preference for happiness. If you never wanted happiness in the first place, you'd be no worse off than someone who finally gains it. The Buddhists were right: desire is the root of all suffering, and the best possible state isn't the satisfaction of all desire, but the lack of all desire. In this context, life is actually quite tragic. Before we were born, there was a total absence of preference on our part because we simply did not exist. As our lives progress, we pick up desires and aversions, and mistakenly believe getting what we desire is something valuable in itself, something that can outweigh life's sufferings if it happens frequently enough. But if I am correct, the best we can hope for is to achieve the very same absence of desire that obtained during our non-existence prior to birth. 

&nbsp;

[If you disagree, recall that your placing absolute value on getting the things you desire is *itself a desire* (namely, a desire to get what you desire), and you must demonstrate that it is more valuable than its absence. That, of course, can be interpreted as a further desire, creating the infinite regress of justification I mentioned earlier.]

&nbsp;

The existence of any conscious self-aware being is therefore best described as a perpetual accumulation and subsequent removal of the tarnish of preference that was bestowed upon it at birth. There is never any good reason to create more want in the world, when so many wants are currently unmet. All of civilization is the result of a massive compounding of desires upon desires, made more subtle and interesting through cultural and technological advancements, but in the end just preferences whose fulfillment is no more valuable than the nothingness of no culture, no technology, no civilization, and no consciousness at all (the present situation on the planet Jupiter, let's say).

&nbsp;

From a moral standpoint, my view is that we are obligated to reduce the number of unsatisfied wants in the world as best as we are able, but we have no obligation to create additional unsatisfied wants just so that we can reduce their number. On the contrary, since not getting what one wants is a negative experience, we ought not to increase the number of unsatisfied wants. Whether or not this means the end of all humanity is a matter of contention; remember that humans are not the only ones on this planet with preferences. Non-human animals vastly outnumber us, and if we were to voluntarily go extinct, it would leave more room for them to multiply, exponentially increasing the (often quite dire) preferences of wildlife across further generations. 

&nbsp;

Even if we somehow managed to sterilize the globe, it would not erase the possibility that life would evolve again in the distant future, nor would it affect the likely existence of other globes teeming with other kinds of life--which, if conscious, will be teeming with desires and aversions much like our own. On an individual level, one might be morally justified in avoiding procreation, but the view from the population level is harder to resolve one way or another. Prolonging our species' existence in the hope that we can create a technological utopia for all preference-bearing beings is not only a lofty aspiration we haven't even begun enact, but is a clear example of manipulation, of going against Kant's imperative to never treat others merely as tools. There seems to be no morally pure course of action; a possible world that adopts universal antinatalism will not be able to contribute to the reduction of suffering in the animal world or on other worlds, but a possible world that pools its resources to enable a technological solution to suffering may require millennia of untold suffering to reach that point, and it may never succeed before eventually going extinct anyway.

&nbsp;

That's really the end of this line of reasoning, for me. No matter what we do, there is no way to outlive the end of the universe, and whenever that happens, the foregoing arguments have demonstrated that the morally relevant interests of conscious beings will simply revert to the baseline of not wanting or needing anything at all, just as though we had never been. If I'm being speculative, my idea of a perfect future for this universe is one where all civilizations have succeeded in sterilizing themselves and as many of their willing neighbors as possible, by voluntarily refusing to procreate and by using technology to remove the ability to procreate from less intelligent organisms. They would leave behind a fleet of non-sentient robots programmed to prevent conscious life from arising anywhere else in the cosmos. Maybe some of them would stick around in a state of constant bliss, but that's not important; if they just managed to die peacefully with no preferences, there would be no need to manufacture and maintain that bliss. 

&nbsp;

This would all be a monumental undertaking, and is extremely unlikely to ever happen, but even if it did, we may simply be one of an infinite number of possible universes, an infinite number of which have not taken this course of action, and so include an infinite number of frustrated preferences. Or maybe universes are cyclical, so that some mechanism in the 11th dimension starts everything up again from scratch after it peters out in the cold darkness. It could be the same every time, or it could be that each iteration is unique, which would again mean infinitely recurring desires and aversions. If this is the case, we are simply doomed."
"""The Symbol Grounding Problem"" (Floridi 2011) [x-post from /r/philosophyOfInfo]Luciano Floridi has offered a solution to the symbol grounding problem by identifying a condition that must be met in order to satisfy the SGP, called the ""Z-condition"", and claiming that no existing computational model satisfies the Z-condition.

What follows is a summary of chapter six of ""The Philosophy of Information"", but please note that the majority of this content is contained in the following self-contained PDF (so you don't need to read the book or really be familiar with the Philosophy of Information to join in this discussion):

http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2542/1/sgpcrfyr.pdf

Because this is of interest to the larger philosophy community, I am cross posting the entirety of the chapter summary (which is almost a word-for-word duplicate of the pdf), but again note that all of the necessary information is contained in the above PDF. Since this is cross-posted to multiple subreddits, I invite you to join us in the main discussion thread at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyOfInfo/comments/2v3oyl/chapter_6_discussion_thread_the_symbol_grounding/

SUMMARY

- Floridi wants to show ""what it means for data to be meaningful and for meaningful data to be truthful"", and that all 
- He introduces the ""Zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition), as the requirement that must be satisfied by a strategy in order to provide a valid solution of the SGP [symbol grounding problem, previously referred to in this book as the data grounding problem]"".

6.1 INTRODUCTION

- SGP - ""How can the data, constituting semantic information, acquire their meaning in the first place? ... The SGP concerns the possibility of specifying *precisely how* a formal symbol system can *autonomously* elaborate its own semantics for the symbols (data) that it manipulates and do so *from scratch*, by interacting with its environment and other formal symbol systems.""
- ""the difficulty is not (or at least, not just) merely grounding the symbols or data somehow successfully, as if all we were looking for were the implementation of some sort of internal look-up table ... the interpretation of the symbols (data) must be *intrinsic* to the symbol system itself, it cannot be *extrinsic,* that is, *parasitic* on the fact that the symbols (data) have meaning for, or are provided by, an interpreter."" (135) 
- He says ""all approaches seek to ground the symbols through the sensorimotor capacities of the artificial agents involved. The strategies differ in the methods used to elaborate the data obtained from the sensorimotor experiences, and in the role (if any) assigned to the elaboration of the data representations ... [but] none of the strategies can be said to offer a *valid* solution to the SGP. We shall see that this does not mean that they are theoretically flawed or uninteresting, nor that they cannot work, when technically implemented. The conclusion is rather that, conceptually, insofar as they seem successful, such strategies either fail to address the SGP or circumvent it, by implicitly presupposing its solution and begging the question."" (135)

6.2 THE SYMBOL GROUNDING PROBLEM

- The challenge posed by the SGP is:
	a) No form of innatism is allowed; no semantic resources can magically be presupposed as being pre-installed in the artificial agent (AA)
	b) No form of externalism is allowed; no semantic resources should be uploaded from the 'outside' by some *deus ex machina* already semantically proficient
	c) The AA may have its own capacities and resources to be able to ground its symbols.
- These three conditions are hereafter referred to as the Zero-semantic commitment condition (Z-condition).
- ""These three conditions only exclude the possibility that such resources may be semantic in the first place"" (137).

6.3 THE REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- This approach ""considers the conceptual and categorical representations, elaborated by an AA as the meanings of the symbols used by that AA. The problem is that ""the available representations---whether categorical or perceptual---succeed in grounding the symbols used by an AA only at the price of begging the question. We shall see that their elaboration, and hence availability, presuppose precisely those semantic capacities or resources that the approach is trying to show to be autonomously evolvable by an AA in the first place."" (138) 
- Harnad's (1990) hybrid model is examined first. If an AA using the hybrid model, which he calls 'Perc', uses say, neural networks to take in perceptual data and create conceptual categories such as 'quadruped animal', the conceptual categories could be considered the meanings of Perc's symbols. But Floridi notes that if the neural network uses supervised learning, it requires an external source of labeled training data and violates part (b) of the Z-condition. If the neural net is unsupervised, then the networks ""still need to have *built-in biases* and feature-detectors in order to reach the desired output. ... Moreover, unsupervised or self-organizing networks, once they have been trained, still need to have their output checked to see whether the obtained structures make any sense with respect to the input data space. This difficult process of validation is carried out externally by a supervisor [which is] entirely *extrinsic*."" **See note 1 in the discussion section below for my take on this.**
- What about an approach that constructs categories automatically given similarities between data? Floridi likens this to a move made by Berkeley in criticism of Locke, and says it still fails: ""how is the class of horses (the data space) put together in the first place, without any semantic capacity to elaborate the general idea ... of 'horse' to begin with? And how is a particular specimen of horse privileged over all the others as being the particular horse that could represent all the others, without presupposing some semantic capacities? And finally, how does one know that what makes that representation of a particular horse the representation of a universal horse is not, for example, the whiteness instead of the four-legged nature of the represented horse?""
- Another representationalist approach is that of Mayo (2003), whose *functional model* of AA shows that AAs can elaborate concepts ""in such a way as to be able to ground even abstract names."" Because data always underdetermine their structure, categories are interpreted as ""task-specific sets that collect representations according to their practical function. Symbols are formed in order to solve specific task-oriented problems in particular environments."" For example, ""an AA can generalize the meaning of the symbol 'victory' if, according to Mayo, 'victory' is not rigidly connected to a specific occurrence of a single event but derives its meaning from the representation of the intersection of all the occurrences of 'victory' in different task-specific sets of various events, such as 'victory' in chess, in tennis, [etc]"".
- Floridi claims that Mayo (2003) still fails the Z-condition because it relies on initial representations (Mayo's ""functional criteria"") which the AA already has access to---thus violating part (a) of the Z-condition.
- Sun (2000) proposes an intentional model which builds on a Heideggerian dichotomy of being-in-the-world and being-with-the-world. ""According to Sun, representations do not stand for the corresponding perceived objects, but rather for the uses that an AA can make of these objects as means to ends."" Sun has a first/bottom level of learning, and a second/top level of learning, with qualitatively different processing mechanisms and knowledge sets, which complement each other.
- But again, Floridi claims, the Z condition is breached already because Sun's approach has ""innate biases or built-in constraints and predispositions which also depend on the (ontogenetic and phylogenetic) history of agent world interaction"".
- Sun's model, called CLARION, employs Q-learning (which is based on reinforcement learning) **(See note 2)**. Floridi notes ""the algorithm works only if the (solution of the) problem can be modelled and executed in a finite time ... it is already clear that, by adopting the Q-learning algorithm, the intentional model is importing from the outside the very condition that allows CLARION to semanticize, since tasks, goals, success, [etc.] are all established by the programmer.""

6.4 THE SEMI-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Semi-representationalist approaches are also representationalist in nature, but deal with the AA's use of its representations by ""replying on principles imported from behaviour-based robotics.""
- Davidsson (1993) says that a description has three parts:
	1) designator - the name (symbol) used to refer to a category;
	2) epistemological representation - used to recognize instances of a category;
	3) inferential representation - a collection of all that is known about a category and its members and can be used to make predictions or infer non-perceptual information.
- Davidsson discusses two paradigms of machine learning: learning by observation (basically unsupervised learning, which Floridi says relies on a programmer to provide ""well-selected description entities""), and learning from examples (which Floridi says not only requires a trainer to select examples to learn from, but also ""presupposes a set of explicitly pre-classified (by the human teacher) examples of the categories to be acquired."" Thus Davidsson's strategy fails.
- Rosenstein and Cohen (1998) try to use a bottom-up process (perception -> symbolic thought), by using a ""method of delays"" allowing the AA to store perceptual data as-is (thus avoiding external semantic committments), a predictive semantics, and an unsupervised learning process which elaborates the semantics. It plots data on a cartesian coordinate system, thus constructing a ""cartesian representation"". But ""this 'Cartesian' semantic framework is entirely extraneous to the AA, either being presumed to be there (innatism) or, more realistically, having been superimposed by the programmer. ... the very interpretation of the data, provided by the actions, as information of such and such a kind of Cartesian coordinate system is, by itself, a crucial semantic step, based on extrinsic criteria.""

6.5 THE NON-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Non-representationalist approaches do not have symbolic representations (at least not in the localist, explicit sense), but for such approaches ""the SGP is merely postponed rather than avoided. ... [I]f it is to develop even an elementary protolanguage and some higher cognitive capacities, it will have to manipulate some symbols, but then the question of their semantic grounding presents itself anew."" **See note 3 below**.
- Floridi recalls the classic papers by Brooks (Brooks 1990,1991) on embodied/situated cognition.
- In his criticism of Billard and Dautenhahn (1999)'s DRAMA system, he notes that it has ""a reliance on neural networks, which incurs the same problems highlighted in section 6.3.1"". **(see note 4 below)**.

CONCLUSION

- ""(the semantic capacity to generate) representations cannot be presupposed without begging the question. Yet abandoning any reference to representations means accepting a dramatic limit to what an AA may be able to achieve semantically"". Instead Floridi introduces seven features that a valid solution to the SGP will need to combine:
1. a bottom-up, sensorimotor approach to the grounding problem;
2. a top-down feedback approach that allows the harmonization of top-level grounded symbols and bottom-level, sensorimotor interactions with the environment;
3. the availability of some sort of representational capacities in the AA;
4. the availability of some sort of categorical/abstracting capacities in the AA;
5. the availability of some sort of communication capacities among AAs in order to ground the symbols diachronically and avoid the Wittgensteinian problem of a 'private language';
6. an evolutionary approach in the development of 1-5;
7. the satisfaction of the Z condition in the development of 1-6."" (161)




DISCUSSION TOPICS

**Note 1** I've seen similar criticisms of solutions to the SGP before where the ""biases"" of some learning algorithm were taken to be signs of the programmer putting semantic information into the system and thus violating the SGP. But this is entirely too nit-picky in my opinion. *Of course* there are biases in any learning algorithm; real-life brains have biases that follow from their constructions: the minimum/maximum firing rate of human neurons, the biologically-determined connectivity between certain parts of the brain, etc. If I created a computer simulation to exactly model the human brain down to the neurobiological level, then nobody could reasonably accuse me of imparting semantic information into that simulation, would they?
And Floridi's statement that unsupervised networks need to have their output checked and therefore they violate the Z-condition is problematic---sparse autoencoders, for example, can learn representations given low-level data by performing their own checks, on their own generated representations. Yes, those checks are subjected to a mathematical error metric that is encoded by a human, but once the formula is encoded once it never has to be changed no matter how many representations are generated---more akin to the constraints set by the physical properties of the brain and neurons themselves!

**Note 2** Ron Sun's solution is classified as representationalist, and then closes the chapter with seven features which presumably he believes are not met with Sun's CLARION architecture. I am extremely familiar with Ron Sun's work; in fact I have published papers with him in the past, and I can tell you this: The majority of Floridi's criticisms in this chapter are based on a 10-year-old misunderstanding of what CLARION can and does do (which is 1-6, and likely 7). 

**Note 3** Does the symbol grounding problem still apply when dealing with representations that use symbols which are not declarative knowledge (knowledge *that*), but rather procedural knowledge (knowledge of *how*)? In the human brain, neurons can be said to have a symbolic state (either firing or not firing) *at a certain level of description*, but this level of description is not explicitly used by the human agent, rather the human behaves *in accordance with* behaviors whose state is set by the states of the neurons. This is quite different than behaving *because* some symbolic reasoning took place.

**Note 4** Now Floridi seems to be treating the use of neural networks as if he has performed a mathematical proof-style reduction to a previously solved problem: simply having a neural network now is sufficient to declare that the system violates the Z-condition? This case is not quite made (see my mention of sparse autoencoder networks). Am I missing something?"

February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"The Mind/Body Problem and Type-Identity TheoryThis is a piece I wrote for my [blog](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/redletteralex) where I cover lots of different things about philosophy and stuff. I just wanted to present it here and get some responses from the community of /r/philosophy  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The mind-body problem is one of the classic problems of philosophy, the modern formulation of which belongs to René Descartes. Simply put, the problem is “how do physical neurological brain states relate to phenomenal mental states?” Descartes tried to solve the problem by saying that the mind and body are not the same and that they are both irreducible primitive substances that have the capacity to influence and cause things in each other. His solution rests on a condition for identity, that is, two things are identical if and only if they share all the same properties. As Descartes defined the mind as a non-extended thinking thing and defined body as an extended non-thinking thing, it follows from his criteria for identity that they cannot by identical for they do not share the same properties. Descartes solution to the problem has a lot of points of contention though. Firstly, how can an immaterial substance (mind) interact with a corporeal substance (body)? According to the Principle of Causal Closure (PCC) all physical effects are entirely exhausted by their physical causes which seems to leave no room for the mind to do any causal work. Moreover, how do we know for certain that the mind is a non-extended thing and how do we know that body is a non-thinking thing? His argument seems to commit the fallacy of the petitio pricinple, that is it begs the question by assuming that mind and body do not have the same properties. Descartes version of substance dualism has long been out of popularity in contemporary philosophy, but it is still widely discussed for its historical importance in setting up the modern day formulation of the mind/body problem.  

During the middle of the 20th century a new solution of the mind body problem arose from the like of philosophers such as U.T. Place and Herbert Feigl. Called the type-identity theory, it proposes that neurological brain states and mental states are not distinct and merely correlated, but they are in fact the same thing, that is, they are identical. An example commonly used is the mental state of being in pain. According to they type identity theory the mental state of being in pain is identical to the neurological state of c-fibers firing. In other words, being in pain just is c-fibers firing. This allows for a dissolution of the causal problem of substance dualism. Mental states have causal efficacy in virtue of being identical to physical brain states. It also allows for a simplification of theories of the mind/brain. Following Occam’s Razor, which states that the simplest explanation is most always the correct one, denying the existence of irreducible physical and mental “stuff” and instead positing only one substance simplifies our picture of the world into a less complex narrative. It is important to realize that this is an ontological thesis about the mind, not a linguistic thesis. Of course we use irreducible mental terms to describe our experience (i.e. “wants”, “desires”, knows”…) but the goal of the project is not to translate these utterances into sentences about synapses, electrons, quarks and the like. The point is that on an ontological level, mental states are identical to physical brain states, regardless of what on the surface our language about mental states and entities implies.  

The type-identity theory of the mind rests on the premise that mental types or kinds are realizable in a one to one correspondence with physical types or kinds. But are we really justified in making this assumption? According to some philosophers such as Hilary Putnam and David Lewis, a singular mental type or kind can be realized by many different physical types or kinds. The argument for this kinda of multiple realizability goes as follows: Say we encounter an alien species that, physiologically, is completely different than humans. Instead of having neural electrical signals for communication from the brain to the rest of the body, this alien species has empty sacs that fill with water or some other fluid. Now lets say we decide to poke at this alien with something sharp. Upon viewing its behavior; it moves away from the stimulus, makes an unpleasant sound, actively avoids the sharp object we poked it with, we would be justified in asserting that the alien is in a state of being in pain. However, since the alien has a vastly different physiology than us, it has no c-fibers to fire, it seems that the same mental type, being in a state of pain, is realized by a physical type that is distinct from c-fibers firing. Since the same mental state of being in pain can be realized by different physical states, it makes sense to say that that mental type is not identical to either physical type, for remember, things are identical if and only if they share all the same properties. If mental states are realizable by many distinct physical states, then it follows that mental states cannot be identical to physical states. This is a powerful objection to the type-identity theory of the mind and has been used to advocate a functionalist theory of mental states.  

Simply put, functionalist theories of the mind assert that mental states are not strictly identical to physical states, but instead can be described by the functional role they play in a larger system. So in our alien example, the mental state of being in pain can be reduced to the functional role it plays in the behavior of the alien, that is, its reaction the being poked with a sharp object. So the mental state of being in pain is described by the causal role it plays by causing other mental states such as the belief that one is in pan, the desire to relieve the pain, the behavior one exhibits when in pain, etc… Any internal state that mediates a similar pattern of causes and effects is pain—regardless of the specific physical mechanisms that mediate the pattern in any given case. Functionalism of the mind works well with comparative neuro-anatomy and physiology between humans and other species as it allows us to keep constant our usages of certain mental predicates such as “being in pain” or “desires” even though the underlying physical mechanism that ground such mental states are physically distinct. Not only is this a logically cohesive idea, it is also grounded in scientific methodology by allowing a sufficiently general schema to capture explanations which seems to be a necessary prescriptive condition for something to be considered a genuine science.  

Notice that functionalist theories of the mind are still physicalist theories of the mind. Physical brain states have ontological primacy in that mental states are dependent on them for their existence, but mental states cannot be fully reduced in a one to one correspondence with brain states. The relationship between the two can be said to be one of supervenience. A cursory definition of supervenience would be that there can be no difference in one without a difference in the other. For example, imagine a set of points in space time that are equidistant from each other so that the set has rotational symmetry. The symmetry of the set of points supervenes on the positions of the individual points; if we move one of the points, the set no longer has symmetry. The symmetry of the set supervenes on the relations between the points in the set such that if we change the position of the points, we no longer have a symmetrical across the set. Notice however that supervenience does not necessarily entail strong reduction. Semantic content of sentences does supervene on syntactical feature of the sentence, but they are not reducible to syntactical feature of the sentence. In much the same way, mental states can be said to supervene on brain states, but are not reducible to brain states.  

Functionalism is a popular position in contemporary philosophy of mind, but that does not mean it is without substantive objections. One possible objection is to deny that similar mental kinds are realized across species. Jaegwon Kim posits that mental kinds are distinct and we must differentiate between “pain-for-a-human” and “pain-for-the-alien”. His argument is an attempt to protect the identity-theory of the mind against multiple realizability arguments. Instead of rendering psychology an autonomous special science, multiple realizability implies that there is no structure-independent scientific psychology. There are only “local” scientific psychologies, each reducible to the theory of the underlying physical mechanisms of the structure-type in question. So the verdict on how successful functionalist theories of the mind are is still out and much great work has been done on the problem in question in the past 30 years. For more reading on the topic I’d recommend the SEP entries on type identity theories of the mind (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/) and multiple realizability (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/) as well as Hilary Putnam’s book Representation and Reality.

"The Possibility of Knowing Thyself: Impressions, Triangulation and why Theories aren't Subjective**Thesis** Part of the reason philosophy exist. Part of the reason philosophy developed naturally. Part of the reason philosophy continues to persist is that it answers some questions that are otherwise unanswerable. These questions take over the limits of science and art, yet we wish to talk about them. And beyond science and art, we can only talk about these subjects in a philosophical manner.

""Philosophical manner"" meaning that philosophical answers aim to answer questions about objectivity and subjectivity without trivializing either one.

One of the question is not so much a direct question but a commandment from one of western philosophy's founding member: Socrates. Socrates directed his followers to know thyself indirectly by the famous dictum: The Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living.

That is, the life you live and are living right now is not worth anything unless you examine it. Like gold in itself is worthless unless you know what properties it has. And you can only know the properties of gold by examining it.

In this post I aim to talk about the framework all humans find themselves in in this endeavor as we seek to find ourselves and make our lives worth living and how we can discover the properties that enrich our lives.
_____________________________________
**Part {1}**

You're an idea. 

Or rather an idea is essential to your being.

Try to exist without having an idea on your mind. This may arguably be possible, for example, through sleep or meditation. But other than in special circumstances, wherever you go you go with an idea on your mind.

The only way to start off defining yourself is going through the idea barrier. Without an idea you cannot exist. To prove you exist, you need an idea first.  

___________________________________

**Part {2}**

To be something is to be that. 

So whatever you are is a reference to what you are. But to make a reference to what you are you have to be something that is referenced or capable of being referenced. 

To reference means to point to something. When you're referencing yourself you're pointing at yourself.

You cannot, however, just point to yourself and find yourself. It's like saying ""A is A"". An ""A"" is worthless without knowing its properties, its relations to other letters, or how it can benefit/enrich you from using it. 

If you point at something that is you, you have to be both the subject and the object in question.

You have to be (1) something that is subjectively evaluating an objective thing and you have to be (2) an objective thing that is being referenced.

___________________________________
**Part {3}**

When we reference an apple, we first get an apple and call it an apple. Then we compare an apple to what an apple is not.

If the apple is red, then we say that the apple is red. But the apple is red because it's not any other color.

The positive and negative qualities are intimately tied. Just because the apple is not blue doesn't mean it's yellow. The apple is both red and not blue. It's not just not (any color but red). The apple is red and not (any color but red).

Why an apple is red can be explained or reasoned in many different ways:

1. We can talk about lights waves 
2. apple genetics 
3. the climate that allowed for red apples to emerge 
4. the environment that favored red apples to continue existing vs different color apples that may have gone extinct or never given a chance to flourish 
5. our vocabulary that says ""red means this particular phenomena"" and an apple that adheres to that definition (""An apple is red because red it word we use to describe the phenomena that the apple is exhibiting"")
6. Etc

Some of these truths are absolutely true no matter the context. Light waves and apple genetics may be true for everyone and everything; regardless if they can understand the concept or not. 

When it comes to vocabulary, we may transfer truths to one another using words but only if those words are grounded in truth AND we agree on the meaning of the words.

We could have a debate that seems contradictory. One side may argue that the apple is red and another that it's blue. And they may both be right if their use of the word correspond to the same phenomena. 

The important or relevant thing to take away from this is that:

1. our portal towards truth depends on our impression of the world.
2. our impression must be neutralized to reach objectivity. 
3. our impression of the world and absolute truth are indistinguishable/inseparable (our impression of everything and anything is founded/reasoned through truths that exist independent of our impressions and that in itself is a truth)
4. our impression of the world is a mixture of truth and subjectivity

We can remove our personal subjectivity in order to concentrate truth (science) or we can indulge in our subjectivity (art). This isn't relevant but your day to day life is probably a somewhat balance between the two.

_______________________________________________
**Part {4}**

To know thyself is to concentrate the truth of your subjectivity. 

Let's say you're colorblind so that an apple I call red you see as forest green. You would live with subjective truths that are based on impressions that may include:

1. It's difficult for you to distinguish between forest green plates and red apple slices laying on top of the plate
2. There are colors that other people can see that you can't
3. There's something in your body that affects the impression you have of the world that results in not seeing things other people see
4. You don't know and can't know the impression non-colorblind people have of red apples

Everything I said in the first half of **Part {3}** can be known by the colorblind person and everything I listed here can be known by the non-colorblind person.

That's because the lists are ideas commenting on truths. They are ideas that beg the question with goal of justifying them. They are ideas that presuppose a foundation for reality. But the ultimate justification is your impression. Not the actual absolute truth that exist independent of you; since its only value is your dependence of it. And your dependence of it is based on impressions.

That's why any scientific question can lead to an ad infinitum ""why"" until it's stopped by ""well that's how far science has gotten us thus far"" or ""well, that's a different field of study."" Although science is humanity's best hope to cure diseases, stabilize inequality, end suffering, and create technological advancement. This isn't criticism or lampooning science. Since each discipline/gaze/etc is limited in scope and science is no exception.

Ideas that comment on truths are called theories or hypothesis. But not all ideas comment on truths. And not all truths need to be unearthed or discovered. Some truths are self-evident. For example, our impression is self-evident and true. And yet our impression of the world begs the question because it's an idea that instinctively and instantly comments on further truth that are not self-evident. 

We can then contribute to the impression of the world through art. Or we can deduce our impression of the world through science.

Necessarily, art carries with it scientific truths that can be uncovered and at the same time scientific truths affect our perspective of our art and artistic unfolding. So even the illusion of removing subjectivity is merely an illusion.

________________________________
**Part {5}**

I'm not a dualist. I favor a threesome perspective. That is founded on triangulation.

To know yourself you first have to find yourself. And as with any mathematical problem or navigation, you need at least two knowns or two coordinates to find yourself. 

I would argue that to find and know thyself you need absolutely need two broad coordinates: Absolute Truth and you. 

The difference between the two is that while you're founded on absolute truth, absolute truth is impermeable. You're not impermeable. You're tainted by subjectivity. You are a changing thing based on the changing universe. It's true that sometimes you're cold and sometimes you're hot. Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad. You regard some things as morally good and other things as morally bad. And what those things are sometimes change and sometimes they don't. But all of it is based on absolute truth. 

Change is part of absolute truth. Everything changes constantly. Any impression of the physical world being stagnant or stationary is an illusion based on impressions. Based on truth and subjectivity. 

It's like a video game that changes maps. The buttons you press are always the same to achieve the desired results.

There may be games that change the button layout each map so that you have to re-adjust, but there is still a foundation of truth that guides the change. There's still an objective. You cannot play a game without there being an objective. Regardless if the objective is created by the game creators or yourself. To move, to think, to do requires a plane where you can triangulate yourself. Whether that's space and time or morality or a video game.

Ultimately, to know thyself is to be aware of how you define what you define. Because the part of you that is based on absolute truth is unchanging and consistent. But it's not physical. It's based on principles that transcend the physical since its properties are evident but inconsistent with how the physical behaves.

______________________________________
**Counterarguments**

On whether **Part {1}** is just Cartesian skepticism: I'm not saying that the physical world can be trivialized or that your ideas take precedence to the physical world. I'm saying that as soon as you start talking, you're bringing an idea to life. You cannot talk or think or exist without bringing an idea to life. Even if you exist without thought there's no way to know you exist because to know you exist is a thought. 

The idea itself can be like a plant that sprouts. We can investigate the origins of the plant and its makeup or we can analyze the plant itself. But you cannot start to talk without there being an idea associated. Your words and thoughts are part of the nutrients that give the plant life, among other things.

One may argue ""what if we program a robot to say 'I exist' or 'I am'"".

I think this goes back to the fundamental question of how can you know thyself.

Doing one of those fancy European philosophy moves we can see it another way. The euro step? No that's basketball. I mean the flipping something on it's head in a very French way.

Asking ""what happens if a robot says 'I exist'"" is the same thing as saying what happens when a rock says ""I exist"" or if another human says ""I exist.""

We can only know they exist insofar as we can see they exist (either artistically or scientifically). The same thing when you yourself say ""I exist."" You exist insofar as you can see yourself.

You see yourself when you express yourself. Sometimes you express yourself and only you can see the expression. Or sometimes you express yourself but only you have the perspective you have (since each person has their own perspective). Either way, you can simultaneously express yourself and see yourself since your perspective is a further expression of you. 

Although usually we express ourselves first and after a while reflect on ourselves. 

In short, we can deduce an existential being exist or not (and in what ways it exists) based on pragmatism. And that pragmatism can be led by science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two. 

Concerning ""science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two,"" we naturally combine both. Furthermore, we can't influence one part without influencing the other. But this unfolding also feeds into who you are and what you can reflect on.

It's bad philosophy to introduce a concept at the end (such as pragmatism) but moving on, your being observes the universe. Your being is indirectly observing absolute truth. And our subjectivity shines a light on different truths that depend on our subjectivity.

We can put our subjectivity aside by cancelling it out in theory and militarize pragmatism in a scientific context and discover ""objective truths"" but even without doing this, your subjectivity runs into objective truths all the time. It's just that our subjectivity measures truth less accurately than science. Although to an equally true degree. 

The only way to measure truth more accurately is through pragmatic effort, then. To DO something first and see what results. Evaluate what you see. Whether it's something artistic or scientific or if it's evaluation artistically or scientifically. To do something, anything, and then to triangulate that something with absolute truth to find yourself. Yourself being a union of the two and thus a triangulation of who you are. If we are to equate who you are with where you are. But finding where you are is the first step of finding thyself.

"Moral motivation and moral realismI originally posted this in /r/askphilosophy, but it got almost no attention there, so I'm reposting it in /r/philosophy to hopefully get a larger audience.  I mainly posted this in order to ask the questions I pose at the end, but I also give arguments in the beginning of the post, so I hope it's not against the rules.  Here it is:

I've been an ardent antirealist about morality, mainly because of Mackie's queerness argument and specifically because of the motivational branch of that argument (laid out here very broadly):

   * If there are moral facts, then they must be intrinsically motivating.

    * No fact is intrinsically motivating; only desires are.

    * Thus, there are no moral facts.

A thought experiment which I think exemplifies the force of this argument is the idea of a Malevolent Dictator Of The Universe who is essentially omnipotent and has a strong desire to torture people for fun, and he is resistant to modifying this desire for any reason due to its strength. From his perspective, there seems to be no reason not to torture people: the probability of any future retribution or rebellion befalling him is 0. There seem to be no arguments or evidence that we could possibly present to the MDOTU making the case for ""one ought not to torture"" that would motivate him even a little bit to not torture, which casts doubt on the prospects of ""one ought not to torture"" being an objective fact, assuming that moral judgements are necessarily supposed to motivate to at least some degree. I think this example is particularly troublesome for varieties of moral realism that identify morality with prudential/rational reasons for action, like the view Michael Smith develops in ""The Moral Problem"". As far as I can tell, the MDOTU is of sound mind and is acting rationally according to his desires, but we want to condemn his actions as unethical.

Shafer-Landau's discussion of motivational externalism - the position that there is no necessary connection between judging that one morally ought to X and being motivated to X - in ""Moral Realism: A Defence"" got me thinking about what types of entities we expect to be susceptible to moral motivation. There are no moral facts or moral arguments that could stop a boulder from rolling down a hill, for example, but we don't take that to be problematic for moral realism. The obvious reply is that this is because a boulder doesn't have a mind, which I completely agree with. But I don't even think that every entity with a mind capable of forming beliefs and being persuaded by rational arguments needs to feel motivated to act in accordance with its moral judgements. Consider a robot AI who has been programmed with an overriding desire to steal every TV set it sees. We might give it an argument or point to a fact that indicates that stealing is wrong, and the robot might completely assent to this, but nonetheless it is incapable of feeling motivated to not steal. Again, I don't think that we should feel that moral realism is jeopardized because of this example: regardless of the basis of moral facts and moral arguments, we shouldn't expect them to convince an AI to go against a hard-coded desire.

I'm not sure if a motivational internalist would feel compelled to respond to the AI example, depending on what variety of internalist they were. Perhaps there are some internalists who assent to ""every entity with a mind must be necessarily motivated to at least some degree by moral judgements"", but if that claim turns out to be too strong, then they can't retreat to ""any mind that wants to be motivated by moral judgements will necessarily be motivated by moral judgements"" because then the view is just tautological, so the question of where to draw the line is raised.

At any rate, the upshot is that I think that adopting something-in-the-neighborhood-of motivational externalism is the best response to the version of the queerness argument I sketched, and it also gives us a response to the Malevolent Dictator thought experiment: if we accept that there are cases where moral judgements are not intrinsically motivating, then the fact that none of our beliefs are intrinsically motivating is not a strike against realism. The fact that we cannot motivate the MDOTU is stop torturing people does not mean that torture is not unethical. (Additionally, we might helpfully point to the psychological feature of the MDOTU that makes him resistant to moral argumentation, for the sake of sketching out a more complete theory).

Granting all that, there still seems to be some conceptual connection between morality and motivation and/or reasons for action, even if it's a defeasible connection. So the project for the realist seems to be to 1) identify some collection of facts that 2) provide motivation to at least some degree to 3) some set of agents with the right mental features 4) at least some of the time. That's a lot to leave unspecified, but I think this is already a much more manageable project than ""describe acts that everyone always has a reason to do, always"" which is where many varieties of moral realism tend to go.

So my questions: am I groping towards any standard metaethical views? Does anyone have suggestions for filling in my 1-4? Should I be worried that my answers to 1-4 might be ""arbitrary""?

Thanks."
"3D printers printing 3D printers. Did we create life?First things first. [3D printers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_printer) can't print themselves yet, but some projects are trying to, and the idea isn't far away once you've gone down the path of 3D printing.

According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Biology), there are 7 criteria for something to pass as living. Arguably depending on your interpretation of definitions, reproducing 3D printers wouldn't pass many of those criteria. But it would pass the reproductive criteria.
So according to wiki it ends here. Reproducing 3D printers aren't life.

My further trail of thought is that those criteria are pretty silly. To me, life isn't necessarily about growth, homeostasis and generally cell-based stuff. Every kind of life we know happens to be cell-based (depending on your opinion of viruses), but I don't think that's a criteria of life. Life is something broader than that. I guess I'm leaning more towards some minimum level of intentional/conscient interaction, which would force me to dismiss plants and some animals as life.

What struck me is that close to similar debates have been had regarding whether or not virus is a form of life. To me the similarity between viruses and reproducing 3D printers is high.

My gut feeling is that reproducing 3D printers wouldn't be life. Essentially because I want to see some intentional choices instead of pure mechanics. But comparing it to many biological organisms that pass as life, I'm torn. Coupled with a chat robot that passed the Turing test (mind) and a mechanism to seek 3D printing material (""food""), I can't really reject the idea of it being life.

By the way, I'm an undergraduate molecular biologist, I'm sorry for any amateur philosophy pitfalls I may have fallen into.

Edit1: After seeing the responses, I realize my focus isn't really on mind/intelligence/AI (although that is interesting). Many organisms today pass as life (some even say viruses are life). Intelligence doesn't seem to be a crucial factor for life (plants, virus, fungus and whatnot). Reproduction on the other hand seems to be a talent of all living things. Given those premises, how do we go about regarding self-reproducing 3D printers as living things? What is lacking? Adaption? Is it a question of us not wanting to recognize man-made or non-cellular life?"
"What is consciousness, and what does it mean to be a conscious entity?As I read more and more about the philosophical ramifications that the exponential growth of science and technology will have on humanity, I find myself thinking more and more about these questions.  Science and technology may not seem to be the subjects that would lead one to questions of consciousness, but when one reads about the exponential growth of computational technologies the bridge between the two, seemingly distinct, subjects is formed.
	We take for granted that we human beings are conscious.  Some people may extend the honor to some animals such as dolphins, some apes, blue whales, and elephants because of their family structures, advanced communication systems, and prolonged adolescent periods, but this could be explained as a product of evolution, being that homo sapiens are rather closely related to some of these organisms, but the question that I am more interested in is if entities that are not of an organic nature could be considered to be conscious.  Could an advanced computer that can think in a manner equal to that of a human mind be considered conscious?  I understand that this question is not the exact one that I posed in my title, but I feel that if we can answer one then we can answer the other.
	Consciousness is loosely defined as the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself; it is subjectivity, awareness, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood and the executive control system of the mind.  This is an adequate definition, but it leaves out the answer to one very important question: where does consciousness reside?  
	The location of one entity’s consciousness may seem like an odd question.  One may be tempted to equate it to the question of where the soul resides, but this question forces one to more clearly define what consciousness is.  
	One might say that the consciousness, like the theological or spiritual soul, resides within the heart (i.e. body) and mind, but as a material realist I find fault with this.  How can the consciousness be directly tied to one’s physical self?  By the age of twenty the majority of a person’s cells are not the same cells that he or she was born with and all of the atoms that make up his or her body, including the brain’s atoms, have been replaced many times.  Our bodies are simply a pattern.  To say that the consciousness has any connection to the physical body is to assert that there is some abstract essence that constitutes a conscious.  I find this to be a baseless assertion.  
	So this brings us to the brain.  The brain, like the body, is also a mere pattern, but it is this organ that thinks, and therefore, the consciousness, all of one’s thoughts, memories, and instincts, is a product of the brain.  This is important to note because the brain is mechanical.  Thinking is the product of electric pulses between neuron connections.  This is why it is possible to create a computer that works in the same manner as the human brain, and due to the Law of Increasing Returns this possibility will soon be a reality, so if consciousness resides in the brain why can’t a nonorganic being (i.e. a computer or “robot”) be conscious?
	The future holds more than just computers that will be equal to and quickly surpass human thinking capabilities.  In Ray Kurzweil’s book The Age of Spiritual Machines he writes about the exponential evolution of technologies, but he also writes that 

“A more challenging but also ultimately feasible scenario will be to scan someone’s brain to map the location, interconnections, and contents of the somas, axons, dendrites, presynaptic vesicles, and other neural components.  Its entire organization could then be re-created on a neural computer of sufficient capacity including the contents of its memory.”

	If this is possible, then what does it say about consciousness?  Kurzweil is talking about taking everything that is in the brain, not just the memories and the instincts, but everything, and downloading it on to a machine of some sort.  If consciousness if the culmination of one’s thoughts then this mechanical device would possess a consciousness, and if this machine also has the ability to think in a manner that allows it to carry on thought based on information gained from the brain scan would this machine not represent the continuity of the original person’s consciousness?  This question leads us to two other distinct questions.  Is life a requirement for and entity to be conscious?  Would these machines be considered alive?
	The second question that I proposed may seem radical, but Mr.Kurzweil does a splendid job of putting such a question into context.  In The Age of Spiritual Machines he writes that

 “Up until now, our morality was tied to the longevity of our hardware.  When the hardware crashed, that was it.  For many of our forebears, the hardware gradually deteriorated before it disintegrated…As we cross the divide to instantiate ourselves into our computational technology, our identity will be based on our evolving mind file.  We will be software, not hardware.
As software, our morality will no longer be dependent on the survival of the computing circuitry.  There will still be hardware and bodies, but the essence of our identity will switch to the permanence of our software.”

I know that I have posed more questions than my title implied, but I hope I was clear in my inquiry and my personal opinions.  I truly wish to hear other people’s thoughts on this subject.

"
"The Meaning Of Life: My Analysis And ThoughtsThis is a question that has been asked since humans first became  conscious intelligent beings. It is arguably the most powerful question  in philosophy, and the one that is most often associated with it. There  have been many different answers to this question throughout history.  Different philosophers, scientists and historians have all attempted to  give their unique spin to the question “what is the meaning of life?”.  In today’s post, I am going to examine some of these ideas, break down  the question into smaller pieces, and articulate my own response to this  philosophical inquiry.

**Before we begin this journey, we must first define two important and relevant terms; the concepts “life” and “meaning”.**  

Let’s first look at three definitions for the word “life”:

1. The condition that distinguishes animals and plants  from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,  functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2. The existence of an individual human being or animal.
3. The period between the birth and death of a living thing, especially a human being.

Let’s now look at three definitions for the word “meaning”:

1. What is meant by a concept?
2. What is the significance of a concept?
3. What is the important or worthwhile quality of a concept?

**Now that we have defined both concepts, let’s break things down even further.**

When we are asking “what is the meaning of life?”, we are essentially asking the following 3 questions:

1. What is life?
2. What is life’s significance?
3. How does one live life in the best possible manner?

After having answered these questions, we will be able to synthesize  all of our ideas and create a response to the question that is the  subject of this article.

**What is life?**

As mentioned earlier, life is the condition that distinguishes  animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for  growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change  preceding death.

**Let’s dive deeper into some of these properties.**

1. Organization. Living things are highly organized,  meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living  organisms are made up of one or more cells, which are considered the  fundamental units of life.
2. Metabolism. Living things must use  energy and consume nutrients to carry out the chemical reactions that  sustain life, such as growing, reproducing and maintain the structure of  their bodies.
3. Homeostasis. The maintenance of a stable internal  environment, even in the face of a changing external environment, is  known as homeostasis.
4. Growth. Living organisms undergo regulated growth.
5. Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce themselves to create new organisms.
6. Response: Living organisms show “irritability,” meaning that they respond to stimuli or changes in their environment.
7. Evolution:  Populations of living organisms can undergo evolution, meaning that the  genetic makeup of a population may change over time.

While understanding this list of properties will not greatly affect  our day-to-day framework of how we think and live our lives, it is still  important to know the difference between a living organism and  non-living entity.

**The next question one might have is, how did life begin?**

Many scientists believe that chemical reactions led to RNA, which was  the first molecule on Earth to self-replicate and begin the process of  evolution that led to more advanced forms of life, including human  beings.

**Now that we know how life began in general, let’s examine how life began for human beings.**

Humans evolved from a species known as Homo erectus. Furthermore,  humans share a common ancestor with chimpanzees. For most of our species  history, we were not the dominant force we are today; we were somewhere  in the middle of the animal food chain. Everything changed during the  cognitive revolution that occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago.

We discovered fire, created tools, and developed language. The most  important thing we did was create and connect around ideas that do not  physically exist, such as religion, politics and capitalism. This level  of imagination and consciousness is something that no other living  entity possesses. It is thanks to the cognitive revolution that we are  the dominant, intelligent and conscious beings that we know ourselves to  be today, and it is thanks to our consciousness that we are able to ask  questions such as “what is the meaning of life?”.

**Another big question that we have is the question of how the Universe started.**

The Big Bang theory is the most commonly accepted response to this.

* The Big Band theory is the prevailing cosmological model  explaining the existence of the observable universe form the earliest  known period through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model  describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high  density and temperature.

In recent years, another theory called String theory has gotten quite popular.

* In String theory, the multiverse is a hypothetical group of  multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that  exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and  the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different  universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”, “other  universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”.

We now understand what characteristics separate living organisms from  inorganic matter, how life began, how humans evolved, and why humans  are different from other living organisms. Furthermore, we are able to  somewhat understand what the Universe is and how it started.

**However, we are still left with many questions.**

Are we special? Are we the only intelligent and conscious entities in  the universe or in the multiverse? Is anything “real”, or are we living  in a simulation? Does God exist? Is there life after death? How do all  of the complexities of the Universe work? Is there a deeper purpose to  life or are we merely just bodies of carbon living in a world that is  random and that does not care about us?

Unfortunately, these questions have no objective answers to them. The  deeper we dig, the more questions we have. Science can only answer so  much. There is only so much we can understand about life, about  existence and about the Universe. String theory says that there are 11  dimensions. Humans are only equipped to experience and understand 4 of  those dimensions. With that being said, the progress that we have made  in the last few hundred years has been remarkable. With every year that  passes, we understand a little bit more about the Universe and about  ourselves.

We are curious beings and we are wired to want to explore, to ask  questions, and to try to find answers to the mysteries of the world.

**What is life’s significance?**

As mentioned, we will never know whether we are merely just bodies of  carbon living in a vast apathetic and random Universe, or whether there  is a deeper purpose to our lives and to our existence. With that being  said, life is still meaningful and significant, and the best way to  figure how is to analyze how we are wired as human beings.

Similar to how machines and robots are wired to think and behave in  certain ways, human beings are wired to want and desire certain things.  If there is one thing I want to emphasize in this section, it’s that  while technology and culture have progressed drastically over the last  100 years, we still have the same desires that we had thousands of years  ago and we have not changed much biologically over that time span. The  only difference between today and two thousand years ago is that we are  now satisfying our desires and needs in newer and more complex ways.

**Physical survival.**

Survival is the deepest and most important instinct that we have. As  mentioned earlier in this article, for most of our specie’s history we  were somewhere in the middle of the animal food chain. Without good  health and a good environment, life is difficult and filled with  suffering. No baby is born ready to give up and commit suicide. It takes  a process full of corruption and suffering for a human being to get to  that point. Humans and animals are wired to want to live. As Abraham  Maslow points out in his hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety  needs are the foundation of his pyramid.

While physical survival used to be the act of running from a tiger or  getting shelter in a cave, physical survival today in the western world  is eating healthy, making money, investing, going to the gym, attaining  influence and power, sleeping well, etc.

**Reproduction.**

Reproduction is survival in a different form; survival of our genes  and of our specie. We are wired to want to procreate. Evolution made the  act of sex enjoyable. Our desire for reproduction has not changed.  What’s changed is that as a result of newer technologies, safety and  security, and world dominance, people realize that taking care of  children is a time-consuming lifestyle and choose to focus on their  other needs and goals first, keeping their desire for children as  something to explore later in their lives. Thanks to technological  advancements such as birth control and abortion, people have more  control over their lives and are able to enjoy the benefits of sex  without its consequences.

**Belongingness and Love.**

Humans beings are social animals. We are not meant to live in  isolation. In large part, the way we learn, understand ourselves and the  world, maintain our health and sanity, and think about and solve  problems is by communicating and cooperating with others. There is a  concept that is known as Dunbar’s number. It is essentially a claim that  humans can maintain no more than 150 friendships and connections at a  time. Yuval Noah Harari’s talks about this in detail in his book  “Sapiens”.

Yuval went on to explain that the reason we are able to cooperate in  large groups and dominate the world despite our cognitive limit to the  number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships,  is because of our ability to connect around shares beliefs, such as  stoicism, Christianity, capitalism, money, etc. This shows just how  important connecting with others is for us. In fact, our ability to  communicate and connect with others is one of the biggest reasons how we  went from being in the middle of the animal food chain to the civilized  and dominant people we are today.  

In connection with this desire to connect with others, we are also  wired to want to love and to be loved. Love is crucial for a child’s development. Without adequate love at  an early age during sensitive and critical periods, children develop  attachment issues that can affect them for the rest of their lives. This  shows just how crucial love is for us. Even when we grow up and become  teenagers and adults, we are still yearning for belongingness and love.  It might be something as simple as having anxiety in high school because  we don’t feel as though we have good friends. It might be the  experience of being depressed because a close family member passed away  and we regret not having told them how much we love them. It might be  throwing a fun surprise birthday party for a best friend or sibling  because of how much we cherish them.

Our desire and need to love and to be loved shows itself in numerous  ways throughout our lives. Christopher McCandless wrote this before his  death, “Happiness only real when shared”. This was coming from a man who  had escaped humanity his whole life and who lived his final days in  isolation in the wilderness. Despite pushing people away his entire  life, McCandless realized moments before his death that our lives are  meaningless if we are not surrounded by loved ones.

Another important form of love is self-love. At the end of day, the  only person that will be there with us at every moment of our lives is  ourselves. It is therefore crucial to have a good relationship with  ourselves. If we can’t love ourselves then how can we expect others to  love us? Ayn Rand put this idea beautifully with this quote, “To say ‘I  love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.”

**Curiosity.**

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Europe with  three ships. The explorer and navigator who completed four voyages  across the Atlantic Ocean is known today as one of the most important  figures in history, opening the way for widespread European exploration  and the colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first  European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Christopher Columbus, as well as the thousands of others throughout  history who put their lives at risk for the sake of curiosity and  exploration, did so because they did not want humanity to be forever  bounded by geography and ignorance. The Apollo Lunar Module Eagle  landing on the moon on July 20, 1969 is another example of humankind  attempting to expend its horizons. History is filled with pioneers and  giants from all fields; people like Socrates, Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da  Vinci, Martin Luther King Jr, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,  etc.

Going out of our comfort zones, taking risks, being creative,  expending our horizons, being curious, asking questions, trying new  things, and exploring the earth and space is something that is deeply  ingrained in us. Our desire to explore and to be curious is something  that sets us apart from all other living organisms; it’s what makes us  unique.

Curiosity doesn’t always have to lead to world-changing events like  stepping on the moon or discovering America. Sometimes, curiosity can be  something as simple as sitting down and writing a paper on a topic we  find interesting. Curiosity can be the experience of taking a vacation  and visiting countries and cultures we have never seen. Curiosity can be  the decision to indulge in good habits and to stick to them despite the  discomfort they may cause at first. Curiosity can be the process of  starting a business on an idea we are passionate about. Curiosity is all  around us, and it is one of the most primal instincts that we have.  Let’s embrace our curiosity and our desire for exploration, and let’s  create lives that we will be proud of.  

**Legacy.**

As mentioned earlier, one of the instincts that motivates us the  instinct for survival. We have already talked about two forms of  survival in this article; physical survival and the survival of our  genes and of our specie. There is a third form of survival that controls  much of what we do in life; spiritual survival. Immortality is a desire  that is primal to us. We have the gift of consciousness, but also its  curse. We are the only living organism that is able to imagine and think  about its own death. We don’t want to die. It’s in our nature to desire  survival. For that reason, we try to stay healthy and to physically  survive for as long as can.

However, physical survival is often not enough. We understand  consciously that there will come a time when our bodies will no longer  be able to function. We understand that we will physically die one day.  For that reason, some people turn to religion and God and believe that  if they live a life following certain commandments and behaving in  certain ways, then they will go to heaven and live for eternity. Others  understand that the afterlife is something that we don’t fully  understand. Is there an afterlife? What happens after death? Despite  physical death, will our spirits and souls live on?

These are all pertinent questions. I have the view that there are  certain things that we can’t control. We can’t control what happens to  us after we die. We can control, however, what we do in this life. We  are not guaranteed the promise of heaven. For that reason, we must turn  our attention to building the best legacy we can. Perhaps our name will  be able to live on for generations. Perhaps the value that we will have  given to humankind will play a role in immortalizing our spirit. Perhaps  the legacy we desire is what we leave behind to our children, to our  family, and to our loved ones.

There is a reason that we still remember the names of some of  history’s greatest and most ambitious. There is a reason we still  remember Socrates, his Socratic method of questioning and the honor he  showed in the face of death. There is a reason we still remember Julius  Caesar, the empire he built, and how his empire played a large role in  the development of modern government. There is a reason we remember  Galileo, why we call him the father of observational astronomy, why we  call him the father of the scientific method, and how he stood up for  his beliefs and was a contrarian at a time when going against the grain  could get one killed. There is a reason we will remember Elon Musk long  after he is dead, and his contributions to electric vehicles, space  travel, and clean energy.

The desire for legacy is a great one; there is a lot of meaning that  can be found in its pursuit. The desire for prestige, for  accomplishment, for competition, and for status are some of the most  primal desires that we have. Abraham Maslow, the prominent psychologist  includes esteem needs and self-actualisation as part of his hierarchy of  needs.

It’s important to understand that only a few will be able to have  their names and work immortalized for centuries. Let’s not let that  derail us. It is not the final product that counts. It is the process of  working on something that is greater than ourselves that is of  paramount significance here. In order to build a great legacy, it is  important to help others, to provide value, and to try to push humanity  forward.

Some people will argue that the desire to work towards a great legacy  is stupid. They will argue that one day humans will go extinct and that  when this happens, nobody will know Galileo, Napoleon, Einstein, or  whoever else we want to name. This is a strong logical argument. The  reason I disagree with this view, however, is that logic is not always  the most important factor in an argument. If there’s one thing I want to  make clear in this article, it’s the important of meaning and of  purpose. Where is the meaning in nihilism? Where is the purpose in  believing that we are insignificant and that our lives will mean nothing  millions of years from now?

Despite the fact that these statements may both be logically correct,  what we are trying to articulate in this article is a framework that  will be helpful in our day-to-day lives. A desire for legacy is not only  deeply wired in us, but it is also honorable to want to better  ourselves and to want to better the world. It is honorable to want to  leave behind a piece of who we are, whether in the form of family, in  the form writing, in the form of art, in the form of inventions, in the  form of exploration, or in whatever other medium we choose.

**Acquiring knowledge and transferring it to future generations.**  

If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s the importance of  protecting our species’ knowledge and successfully transferring it  across generations. This goes back to our desire for survival, and more  specifically our desire for the survival of our species. If we do not  safeguard our knowledge, then how can we make sure that the human  species will progress? How can we make sure that we will learn from  history and not commit mistakes that we have committed in the past? We  can’t. It is why books have always been valuable.

Walking in a library is one of the most surreal things that one can  experience. In a library, we have the ability to read from the greatest  minds of human history; Plato, Aristotle, Albert Einstein, Stephen  Hawking, Will Durant, etc. We have more books and more wisdom than can  last a lifetime. Furthermore, our brain is a muscle and it must be  trained. If we spend our days mindlessly scrolling social media and not  putting our brain to use, then we will develop mental problems later in  life and we will not have fulfilled even an ounce of the potential that  we have.

It is our duty to acquire knowledge, to learn as much as we can, and  to put this knowledge into practice. Despite having books and wisdom  from some of the greatest thinkers of all time, our world and our  societies still face many problems. Every era has its own unique set of  problems, and it is our responsibility to learn as much as we can and to  turn our knowledge into practical action. Furthermore, it is our  responsibility transfer our species’ and our personal knowledge to our  kids and future generations so that they will be well equipped to deal  with the challenges of their time.

**Well-being.**

If there is one thing that almost all religions, philosophies, and  schools of thought have in common, it’s that they aim to reduce  suffering and increase well-being.

* Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and  prosperity. It includes having good mental health, high life  satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to manage  stress.

The desires to reduce stress, and to experience happiness and  prosperity are fundamental to who we are. Throughout much of our  species’ history, we experienced wars, diseases, natural catastrophes,  etc. Christopher Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author  wrote the following, “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely  at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history”. This  is a fascinating statistic.

As mentioned earlier, our desires for competition and status, and our  instinct to separate into groups are all part of what makes us human.  Despite all the good that has come from those desires, there has also  been a lot of suffering that has resulted from them. The world can  sometimes be a cruel place filled with evil. It is for this reason that  so many religions and philosophies have attempting to figure out ways in  which we can reduce suffering.

A large part of well-being has to do with health. Gut health, for  example, is strongly correlated with mental health. It is for this  reason that people who have gut problems suffer in life satisfaction. To  be happy, healthy, and to prosper are goals that everyone has. A big  part of making progress towards those goals is combining a lot of the  things that have already talked about in prior sections of this article.  Are we living healthy lives? Are we constantly trying to learn more and  expend our horizons? Do we feel loved and are we surrounded by people  who cherish us? Are we working on our legacies and on projects that  excite us, or are we wasting our time and potential?

Happiness is not something that should be chased. The more we chase  happiness, the more miserable we will be. There is a great book about  this topic called “The Language of Emotions”. It’s important for us to  understand that all emotions are equally important, and that each  emotion serves its own unique purpose. Anger, for example, allows us to  create boundaries. Sadness allows us to release energy. Fear lets us  know when we are in danger. We need to allow happiness to come as a  by-product of a life well-lived, and when it does come, we need let it  be free like a bird; it will come and go when it pleases.

Contentment is a far better thing to aim for. When we are content, we  are grateful for everything that we have. With that being said, we  still try to get a little bit better every day. Mindfulness is also  important. In today’s world of over-stimulation, instant gratification,  and constant comparison, it is easy for us to spend much of our time  either stressing about the future or being depressed about the past.  It’s important to take a step back, to be grateful, and to ask ourselves  what we can do today to better our lives and to create good habits.

Finally, we need to understand that well-being is something that is  unique to each of us. What motivates me and makes me happy, might be  different than what motivates you and makes you happy. It is our  responsibility to have self-awareness, to understand ourselves, and to  understand what drives us.

**How does one live life in the best possible manner?**

Let’s look at what some famous thinkers, philosophies, religions, and schools of thought have said about this.

**Stoicism.**

* Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in  Athens in the early 3rd c entury BC. It is a philosophy of personal  ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural  world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to meaning  and happiness is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,  by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or  by the fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to  do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating  others fairly and justly.

Stoicism was the primary philosophy during the time of the Roman  Empire. The beautiful thing about Stoicism is that arguably the two most  famous Stoics in history came from completely opposing situations and  classes; Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a man who was born  a slave. Despite their complete opposing life situations, both Marcus  Aurelius and Epictetus wrote and talked about all of the same Stoic  virtues. In recent years, Stoicism has had a resurgence. Marcus  Aurelius’ journal “Meditations” is now one of the most famous books in  the world. Furthermore, books from modern writers such as Ryan Holiday  have brought Stoicism into the mainstream.

**Existentialism.**

* Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores  the problem of human existence and centers on the lived experience of  the thinking, feeling, acting individual. In the view of the  existentialist, the individual’s starting point has been called “the  existential angst,” a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or  anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.  Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the  meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were some of the first and most important existentialists.

* Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is  that existence precedes essence, which means that individuals shape  themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived  categories, an “essence”. The actual life of the individuals is what  constitutes what could be called their “true essence” instead of an  arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings,  through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a  meaning to their life.

**Epicureanism.**

* Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BC  based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.  Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable  pleasure in the form of tranquility and freedom from fear, and the  absence of bodily pain through knowledge of the workings of the world  and limiting desires.
* Epicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life.  Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest  amount of pleasure possible during one’s lifetime yet doing so  moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in  such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than  on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially  produced desires were to be suppressed.

**Objectivism.**

* Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by  Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in  her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged  (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books. Rand described  Objectivism as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own  happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement  as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”.

I read a large portion of the book “The Fountainhead” about a year  ago and I enjoyed it. This is one of the passages that has stuck with  me.

* “It is not in the nature of man–nor of any living entity–to start out by  giving up, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that  requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man.  Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run  down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or  how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their  elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning  one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’s values; practicality, of  losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that  fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and  reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek  a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.”

The reason I like this passage so much is because it communicates in  very clear and poetic terms the idea that a desire for meaning and that a  desire for improvement and greatness are core elements of who we are.

**Logotherapy.**

* Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor  Frankl. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the  belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most  powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to  this system is given in Frankl’s most famous book, Man’s Search for  Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his  Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and  reinforced his theories.
* According to Frankl, “We can discover this meaning in life in  three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by  experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude  we take toward unavoidable suffering” and that “everything can be taken  from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose  one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.

**My Thoughts.**

As can be seen, there exists many great schools of thoughts and  philosophies. What almost all of them have in common is the emphasis  they place on pursuing meaning. We live in a world filled with instant  gratification, overstimulation, misinformation, censorship, anxiety and  fearmongering. Furthermore, we live in a world and in an environment  that pedestalizes short-term harmful pleasure and makes it difficult to  delay gratification and pursue meaningful projects and activities. It is  our duty as individuals to take responsibility for our lives, to work  to better ourselves in incremental fashion, to work to better the world,  to try to enjoy the process of life, to love ourselves, and to pursue  meaning rather than short-term detrimental pleasure.

As mentioned earlier in his article, the are many existential and  philosophical questions that we are not able to answer. Perhaps with the  advancement of science we will one day be able to better comprehend the  complexities of the Universe. However, for the time being, we must  focus on what we can control as individuals and create frameworks for  thinking and living that are helpful for our development.

I believe that a large part of the meaning of life is to live  according to our instincts; maintaining good health, being surrounded by  people we love, working on our legacies, acquiring knowledge,  transferring our knowledge across generations, procreating, and placing  great importance on our well-being. However, it’s important to also  understand that we are not chained by our instincts. Each of us have  something special in us that gives us the ability to think and to be  creative. This ability to be flexible, to explore, to try new things, to  learn from great thinkers and philosophers, to go outside of our  comfort zones, to take risk, to go against the grain, to be contrarians,  to be creative, to think outside the box, and to constantly ask  questions and find solutions is what makes us special.

Going back to Viktor Frankl, one of my favorite quotes is the  following, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that  space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our  growth and our freedom.”

I want to emphasize once more that there is meaning in life and that  this meaning can be found all around us. We sometimes see people who  have fallen into nihilism. As someone who once fell into nihilism,  perhaps I can shed some light on my experience and on why nihilism can  be appealing.

* Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that  nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with  extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

The reason I fell into nihilism was because I was going through a  difficult time in my life. I had just moved cities and schools, and I  had left behind all of my childhood friends and almost everything that  was a constant in my life. This happened when I was a young teenager and  it was the worst experience of my life. At the time, I struggled  greatly with understanding my emotions and with social anxiety. It took  many months for me to finally come to terms with my situation and to get  out of denial. For a long time, I tried to convince myself that my  situation was okay and that everything would be alright. I struggled  with anxiety, with depression, and with many more problems.

With that being said, the story has a happy ending; I got closure and  I now live a life where I am generally happy and motivated. My point  with this entire story is that sometimes our life experiences lead us to  philosophies that serve as defence mechanisms. Nihilism, as well as the  belief that free will does not exist, allowed me to tell myself, “life  is meaningless, and I have no control over my situation”. Nihilism was  an escape. The rose-coloured glasses that I had been so accustomed to  wearing had turned into dark-coloured glasses. I was seeing the world  through a completely different lens. When we feel that there is no  meaning in life, it’s probably because something has gone terribly wrong  in our lives.

Of course, this is not always the case. There are plenty of nihilists  out there that believe in nihilism because they believe it to be the  most logical framework for understanding the world. However, as  mentioned earlier in this article, logic is not the only way to go about  looking for truth and examining topics such as the meaning of life;  emotions and instincts are sometimes just as important. An obsession  with logic leads to skepticism. David Hume demonstrated this with “the  problem of induction”. The problem of induction essentially explains  that nothing in the Universe can be proven for certainty. The problem of  induction, as mind-boggling as it is, demonstrates that the odds of the  sun rising tomorrow are equal to the odds of the sun not rising  tomorrow. That is the problem when we put logic on a pedestal and don’t  consider other important factors.

Nihilism is not natural because it looks at the world through a  pessimistic and defeatist lens, which is antithetical to how we are  wired and to who we are as human beings. No baby is born a nihilist.  Going back to Ayn Rand’s quote, “It is not in the nature of man–nor of  any living entity–to start out by giving up, by spitting in one’s own  face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose  rapidity differs from man to man.”

With closure, with life experiences, with the process of slowly  improving, with information on how to deal with grief, and with  knowledge on life and existence, I went from being a nihilist to the  person I am today, the person I have always truly been; someone who  looks at the world with a glass half-full, someone who looks at the  world with curiosity, wonder and love, and someone who believes in  meaning, pursues meaning, and lives a life of meaning.

To further emphasize my point that life has meaning, and that  striving for meaning is natural and a core part of who we are, let’s  look at the science. Psychologist Jordan Peterson talks about the  orienting reflex in many of his lectures online. He explains that our  brain produces a very complex internal model of the world, and that our  senses produce a model of the external world. The hippocampus watches  those two models to see if they match, and if they don’t match, then a  mismatch signal is created; the orienting reflex.

* The orienting reflex is an organism’s immediate response to a  change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to  elicit the startle reflex. The orienting reflex is a reaction to novel  or significant stimuli.

The orienting reflex essentially serves as a compass of meaning for  us; it is an instrument that guides us through life. It is one of the  deepest instincts that we have. The best way to articulate this point is  by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, M. J. DeMarco:

* “Your soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced  with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or  during a massage. How are you responding to your soul’s voice? Is it  denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work?  Distracted by a television? Honored?”

When we are wasting time and when we are indulging in behaviours and  activities that lack meaning, that are unnatural, and that are  antithetical to growth, our orienting reflex will let us know. It is our  responsibility to listen to our voice, to accept the mistakes that  we’ve made, and to take steps towards the right direction. Life is  filled with meaning. We must open our eyes and we must embrace this  meaning. Meaning is a core part of who we are, and we must live in  accordance to the instincts and purposes that have been explained and  analyzed in this article. Furthermore, we must also not follow  philosophies and ideas blindly and dogmatically, and we must understand  that the journey of life and the journey of meaning is unique to each of  us.

This article was a collection of thoughts from some of the greatest  thinkers of all time, as well as my own thoughts and my attempt to  synthesize all of this information. It is worth noting that someone  might read this article and not agree with everything. That is okay, and  it is completely normal. Each of us are at a different stage in our  process of life, and we come from different environments and have  different genetics. Despite the objective nature of some of these ideas,  the way I view life and the way you view life will not always be the  same. Two of the most important skills one can have are self-awareness  and critical thinking. If we are able to understand ourselves and our  thought process, and if we are able to question ourselves and to  question the world, then we have what it takes to grow as human beings  and to tackle difficult questions such as “what is the meaning of life?

Best of luck my fellow readers. Please feel free to reach out to me to ask any questions or to discuss some of these ideas!"
"Defeating the ""what about humans?"" argument for veganismMany people have effectively argued that we shouldn't eat meat from factory farms or other farms where animals are raised in bad conditions. For the purposes of this post I'll just assume this position.

But some go further and argue that it is wrong even to raise an animal for food in a good environment. Even if its life is good with positive well-being, it's still wrong to create such animals, therefore animal farming is always wrong. This doesn't make a lot of sense on its face: it's *good for* the animal, it has a *happy* life, how can it be wrong to kill it? But the vegans have a defense: imagine if they did this to humans. Would you support raising humans and then killing them for food? Of course not! It's barbaric! And so the vegan wins the argument.

There is one line of response to this which says that humans deserve rights which animals don't. Even though both animals and humans are moral patients, and both deserve not to suffer unnecessarily, humans (and whatever rare or hypothetical animals happen to have human-like levels of rational thinking, social standing, cognition, etc) also have special rights not to be raised and slaughtered. Thus, it's consistent to say that it's wrong to farm humans but not wrong to (humanely) farm animals.

That's one response, which I won't go into here. Agree or disagree with it at your leisure. Instead I will show how we can respond to the vegan argument while preserving a fully welfare-oriented perspective. And the first way to do that is to simply deny the assumption that farming humans would be wrong.

We can take it for granted that doing this in *reality* doesn't make sense: there would be too many social problems, it would be extremely economically inefficient, etc. Even if we allowed, say, consenting parents to produce and slaughter an infant, that would generate enough pure outrage and family tension to far outweigh the minor nutritional and gustatory benefits. 

However, let's imagine a world where people can be raised for food and it actually 'works'. E.g., suppose that aliens have watch over the Earth and they beam people away for euthanasia as they get older, something universal and predictable just like natural old age death. And suppose the aliens had planted humans on Earth just for this purpose. Is that better than Earth being an empty world? To me, it seems like it is better. I would rather live on such a world than have no life at all. 

Also, there is no need to restrict our focus to meat. Humans (and animals) could be raised and sacrificed for a wide number of things. For instance, it could be for organs - which I think we can commonly agree is no different from being raised and sacrificed for meat, except for the fact that organs are more important (they could save lives).

More interestingly, humans could be raised for sacrifice in other ways. Imagine that you are a Star Wars clone trooper who is tasked with guarding a robotic mining operation on another planet. Your job is for economic purposes rather than saving people's lives, you could be killed instantly by a surprise strike (suppose it is inevitable given enough time), but until then you have a decent life, almost no labor and enjoy just hanging around. Is it wrong that the mining company had you cloned, even as you are personally glad for it? I don't see this as the case. Of course, you might prefer an *even better* life (don't we all), but that doesn't change the basic fact that your life is better than nonexistence. Alternatively, rather than being raised for sacrifice, you could be raised for your labor (e.g. you are a cloned miner), still with a better life than nonexistence.

In logical terms, it sure seems like these things are morally equivalent to raising humans for meat, but they don't feel as wrong. How do we square these intuitions? Maybe raising humans for meat and labor are both wrong, or maybe they are both right. Either is possible, but this new perspective does make it easier to accept that raising humans for meat is right. It is no longer the stuff of absurdity, because the alternative is to take the mildly objectionable position that these mining operations are wrong.

But there is a way to draw a moral distinction between the two cases. Combat and mining and other pursuits befit the capacities of a human. Of course they are not perfect, they are not fully utilizing our human abilities. But for practical purposes, they come reasonably close. You need human intelligence and human dexterity to perform these tasks. On the other hand, raising a human for food does *not* befit human capacities. Our human strengths and abilities go unused as we are relegated to doing something that animals could do. Thus, being a soldier or a miner provides a kind of *objective* well-being that we lack when we are playing the role of livestock.

So we could say that farming humans is wrong. Does this condemn humane animal farming? No! Because if we want to be consistent, we must judge animal farming by whether it befits *their* capacities, not human ones. To be sure, even on a humane farm, animals are not completely fulfilling all their roles and making use of all their unique abilities. But that is true for the human soldiers and miners anyway. These humans utilize their capacities to a *decent degree*, and humanely raised livestock utilize their capacities to a *decent degree* (they eat, they grow, they run around, etc). When you combine this with perfectly adequate pleasure and little amount of pain, things are good overall. Things don't have to be perfect in order to be good.

In summary, there are two viable ways to provide a welfarist response to the vegan *reductio ad absurdum* against humane farming. The first is to outright deny that farming humans is, in principle, a bad thing. The second is to say that humans raised for food will necessarily have less *objective well being* than animals who are raised for food, because they are not being raised for the capacities befitting their species. When humans are economically raised purely for a purpose that does befit our species capacities (such as combat or mining), that is morally equivalent to humane animal farming, and both are better than nonexistence."
"Asimov's Three LawsI was thinking about Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, which are as follows for those who don't know:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

I have ethical problems with the first and the third laws, and wanted to get Reddit's opinion/wisdom on the matter.

Concerning the first law, what if a situation arose where the robot had two choices, both of which involved harming humans? For instance let's take that old ethical problem (I may not have the details exactly right, but the principle is the same): There's a train, with no brakes, rolling down the tracks towards a large group of people. You're steering the train. You can either move the train to the side, killing a lone, innocent person, or not do anything and allow the train to kill multiple innocent people. What would the robot, following the Three Laws, do if it were steering the train? If he doesn't make a decision or decides not to change the train's course (effectively the same thing), he kills more people than if he takes action and steers the train (only killing one person). If you amended the law to say, ""if forced to react to a situation where the only choices, as well as inaction, caused harm to humans, kill as few as possible"", isn't that a utilitarian point of view? I personally agree with this, but many humans would disagree (they're the ones who would choose to let the train stay on its course). How do we decide what the robot is to do?

Concerning the third law, my problem is: why should we force robot to continue being in existence? If robots somehow developed the thought capacity to question their own existence, and choose not to continue living, then wouldn't forcing them to obey this law be cruel? Or would this law automatically force robots to desire to continue living as long as possible (their programming wouldn't allow them to have suicidal thoughts). If so is that unfair? What if they developed the capacity for pain - would the law still be just if they could feel pain? In questioning this law I also find that the second law is unjust if robots gained this level of consciousness (robots would effectively be forced into slavery). So i guess my question becomes: do the three laws limit the capacity of thought a robot could have? And is this fair?

Sorry this is a little stream of consciousness-ish. For those of you lazy bums:

TL;DR: When considering the first law, what should a robot do if forced into a situation that will harm humans no matter what choice is made (or isn't made). And do the second two laws limit the capacity of thought robots can have, and if so is it fair for humans to put a cap on the intelligence of other life forms?"
"""The Symbol Grounding Problem"" (Floridi 2011) [x-post from /r/philosophyOfInfo]Luciano Floridi has offered a solution to the symbol grounding problem by identifying a condition that must be met in order to satisfy the SGP, called the ""Z-condition"", and claiming that no existing computational model satisfies the Z-condition.

What follows is a summary of chapter six of ""The Philosophy of Information"", but please note that the majority of this content is contained in the following self-contained PDF (so you don't need to read the book or really be familiar with the Philosophy of Information to join in this discussion):

http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2542/1/sgpcrfyr.pdf

Because this is of interest to the larger philosophy community, I am cross posting the entirety of the chapter summary (which is almost a word-for-word duplicate of the pdf), but again note that all of the necessary information is contained in the above PDF. Since this is cross-posted to multiple subreddits, I invite you to join us in the main discussion thread at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyOfInfo/comments/2v3oyl/chapter_6_discussion_thread_the_symbol_grounding/

SUMMARY

- Floridi wants to show ""what it means for data to be meaningful and for meaningful data to be truthful"", and that all 
- He introduces the ""Zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition), as the requirement that must be satisfied by a strategy in order to provide a valid solution of the SGP [symbol grounding problem, previously referred to in this book as the data grounding problem]"".

6.1 INTRODUCTION

- SGP - ""How can the data, constituting semantic information, acquire their meaning in the first place? ... The SGP concerns the possibility of specifying *precisely how* a formal symbol system can *autonomously* elaborate its own semantics for the symbols (data) that it manipulates and do so *from scratch*, by interacting with its environment and other formal symbol systems.""
- ""the difficulty is not (or at least, not just) merely grounding the symbols or data somehow successfully, as if all we were looking for were the implementation of some sort of internal look-up table ... the interpretation of the symbols (data) must be *intrinsic* to the symbol system itself, it cannot be *extrinsic,* that is, *parasitic* on the fact that the symbols (data) have meaning for, or are provided by, an interpreter."" (135) 
- He says ""all approaches seek to ground the symbols through the sensorimotor capacities of the artificial agents involved. The strategies differ in the methods used to elaborate the data obtained from the sensorimotor experiences, and in the role (if any) assigned to the elaboration of the data representations ... [but] none of the strategies can be said to offer a *valid* solution to the SGP. We shall see that this does not mean that they are theoretically flawed or uninteresting, nor that they cannot work, when technically implemented. The conclusion is rather that, conceptually, insofar as they seem successful, such strategies either fail to address the SGP or circumvent it, by implicitly presupposing its solution and begging the question."" (135)

6.2 THE SYMBOL GROUNDING PROBLEM

- The challenge posed by the SGP is:
	a) No form of innatism is allowed; no semantic resources can magically be presupposed as being pre-installed in the artificial agent (AA)
	b) No form of externalism is allowed; no semantic resources should be uploaded from the 'outside' by some *deus ex machina* already semantically proficient
	c) The AA may have its own capacities and resources to be able to ground its symbols.
- These three conditions are hereafter referred to as the Zero-semantic commitment condition (Z-condition).
- ""These three conditions only exclude the possibility that such resources may be semantic in the first place"" (137).

6.3 THE REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- This approach ""considers the conceptual and categorical representations, elaborated by an AA as the meanings of the symbols used by that AA. The problem is that ""the available representations---whether categorical or perceptual---succeed in grounding the symbols used by an AA only at the price of begging the question. We shall see that their elaboration, and hence availability, presuppose precisely those semantic capacities or resources that the approach is trying to show to be autonomously evolvable by an AA in the first place."" (138) 
- Harnad's (1990) hybrid model is examined first. If an AA using the hybrid model, which he calls 'Perc', uses say, neural networks to take in perceptual data and create conceptual categories such as 'quadruped animal', the conceptual categories could be considered the meanings of Perc's symbols. But Floridi notes that if the neural network uses supervised learning, it requires an external source of labeled training data and violates part (b) of the Z-condition. If the neural net is unsupervised, then the networks ""still need to have *built-in biases* and feature-detectors in order to reach the desired output. ... Moreover, unsupervised or self-organizing networks, once they have been trained, still need to have their output checked to see whether the obtained structures make any sense with respect to the input data space. This difficult process of validation is carried out externally by a supervisor [which is] entirely *extrinsic*."" **See note 1 in the discussion section below for my take on this.**
- What about an approach that constructs categories automatically given similarities between data? Floridi likens this to a move made by Berkeley in criticism of Locke, and says it still fails: ""how is the class of horses (the data space) put together in the first place, without any semantic capacity to elaborate the general idea ... of 'horse' to begin with? And how is a particular specimen of horse privileged over all the others as being the particular horse that could represent all the others, without presupposing some semantic capacities? And finally, how does one know that what makes that representation of a particular horse the representation of a universal horse is not, for example, the whiteness instead of the four-legged nature of the represented horse?""
- Another representationalist approach is that of Mayo (2003), whose *functional model* of AA shows that AAs can elaborate concepts ""in such a way as to be able to ground even abstract names."" Because data always underdetermine their structure, categories are interpreted as ""task-specific sets that collect representations according to their practical function. Symbols are formed in order to solve specific task-oriented problems in particular environments."" For example, ""an AA can generalize the meaning of the symbol 'victory' if, according to Mayo, 'victory' is not rigidly connected to a specific occurrence of a single event but derives its meaning from the representation of the intersection of all the occurrences of 'victory' in different task-specific sets of various events, such as 'victory' in chess, in tennis, [etc]"".
- Floridi claims that Mayo (2003) still fails the Z-condition because it relies on initial representations (Mayo's ""functional criteria"") which the AA already has access to---thus violating part (a) of the Z-condition.
- Sun (2000) proposes an intentional model which builds on a Heideggerian dichotomy of being-in-the-world and being-with-the-world. ""According to Sun, representations do not stand for the corresponding perceived objects, but rather for the uses that an AA can make of these objects as means to ends."" Sun has a first/bottom level of learning, and a second/top level of learning, with qualitatively different processing mechanisms and knowledge sets, which complement each other.
- But again, Floridi claims, the Z condition is breached already because Sun's approach has ""innate biases or built-in constraints and predispositions which also depend on the (ontogenetic and phylogenetic) history of agent world interaction"".
- Sun's model, called CLARION, employs Q-learning (which is based on reinforcement learning) **(See note 2)**. Floridi notes ""the algorithm works only if the (solution of the) problem can be modelled and executed in a finite time ... it is already clear that, by adopting the Q-learning algorithm, the intentional model is importing from the outside the very condition that allows CLARION to semanticize, since tasks, goals, success, [etc.] are all established by the programmer.""

6.4 THE SEMI-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Semi-representationalist approaches are also representationalist in nature, but deal with the AA's use of its representations by ""replying on principles imported from behaviour-based robotics.""
- Davidsson (1993) says that a description has three parts:
	1) designator - the name (symbol) used to refer to a category;
	2) epistemological representation - used to recognize instances of a category;
	3) inferential representation - a collection of all that is known about a category and its members and can be used to make predictions or infer non-perceptual information.
- Davidsson discusses two paradigms of machine learning: learning by observation (basically unsupervised learning, which Floridi says relies on a programmer to provide ""well-selected description entities""), and learning from examples (which Floridi says not only requires a trainer to select examples to learn from, but also ""presupposes a set of explicitly pre-classified (by the human teacher) examples of the categories to be acquired."" Thus Davidsson's strategy fails.
- Rosenstein and Cohen (1998) try to use a bottom-up process (perception -> symbolic thought), by using a ""method of delays"" allowing the AA to store perceptual data as-is (thus avoiding external semantic committments), a predictive semantics, and an unsupervised learning process which elaborates the semantics. It plots data on a cartesian coordinate system, thus constructing a ""cartesian representation"". But ""this 'Cartesian' semantic framework is entirely extraneous to the AA, either being presumed to be there (innatism) or, more realistically, having been superimposed by the programmer. ... the very interpretation of the data, provided by the actions, as information of such and such a kind of Cartesian coordinate system is, by itself, a crucial semantic step, based on extrinsic criteria.""

6.5 THE NON-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Non-representationalist approaches do not have symbolic representations (at least not in the localist, explicit sense), but for such approaches ""the SGP is merely postponed rather than avoided. ... [I]f it is to develop even an elementary protolanguage and some higher cognitive capacities, it will have to manipulate some symbols, but then the question of their semantic grounding presents itself anew."" **See note 3 below**.
- Floridi recalls the classic papers by Brooks (Brooks 1990,1991) on embodied/situated cognition.
- In his criticism of Billard and Dautenhahn (1999)'s DRAMA system, he notes that it has ""a reliance on neural networks, which incurs the same problems highlighted in section 6.3.1"". **(see note 4 below)**.

CONCLUSION

- ""(the semantic capacity to generate) representations cannot be presupposed without begging the question. Yet abandoning any reference to representations means accepting a dramatic limit to what an AA may be able to achieve semantically"". Instead Floridi introduces seven features that a valid solution to the SGP will need to combine:
1. a bottom-up, sensorimotor approach to the grounding problem;
2. a top-down feedback approach that allows the harmonization of top-level grounded symbols and bottom-level, sensorimotor interactions with the environment;
3. the availability of some sort of representational capacities in the AA;
4. the availability of some sort of categorical/abstracting capacities in the AA;
5. the availability of some sort of communication capacities among AAs in order to ground the symbols diachronically and avoid the Wittgensteinian problem of a 'private language';
6. an evolutionary approach in the development of 1-5;
7. the satisfaction of the Z condition in the development of 1-6."" (161)




DISCUSSION TOPICS

**Note 1** I've seen similar criticisms of solutions to the SGP before where the ""biases"" of some learning algorithm were taken to be signs of the programmer putting semantic information into the system and thus violating the SGP. But this is entirely too nit-picky in my opinion. *Of course* there are biases in any learning algorithm; real-life brains have biases that follow from their constructions: the minimum/maximum firing rate of human neurons, the biologically-determined connectivity between certain parts of the brain, etc. If I created a computer simulation to exactly model the human brain down to the neurobiological level, then nobody could reasonably accuse me of imparting semantic information into that simulation, would they?
And Floridi's statement that unsupervised networks need to have their output checked and therefore they violate the Z-condition is problematic---sparse autoencoders, for example, can learn representations given low-level data by performing their own checks, on their own generated representations. Yes, those checks are subjected to a mathematical error metric that is encoded by a human, but once the formula is encoded once it never has to be changed no matter how many representations are generated---more akin to the constraints set by the physical properties of the brain and neurons themselves!

**Note 2** Ron Sun's solution is classified as representationalist, and then closes the chapter with seven features which presumably he believes are not met with Sun's CLARION architecture. I am extremely familiar with Ron Sun's work; in fact I have published papers with him in the past, and I can tell you this: The majority of Floridi's criticisms in this chapter are based on a 10-year-old misunderstanding of what CLARION can and does do (which is 1-6, and likely 7). 

**Note 3** Does the symbol grounding problem still apply when dealing with representations that use symbols which are not declarative knowledge (knowledge *that*), but rather procedural knowledge (knowledge of *how*)? In the human brain, neurons can be said to have a symbolic state (either firing or not firing) *at a certain level of description*, but this level of description is not explicitly used by the human agent, rather the human behaves *in accordance with* behaviors whose state is set by the states of the neurons. This is quite different than behaving *because* some symbolic reasoning took place.

**Note 4** Now Floridi seems to be treating the use of neural networks as if he has performed a mathematical proof-style reduction to a previously solved problem: simply having a neural network now is sufficient to declare that the system violates the Z-condition? This case is not quite made (see my mention of sparse autoencoder networks). Am I missing something?"
"Trying to justify existence.Emotionally, I favour existence over non-existence, but I'd like to be able to justify this to myself on a rational basis. Not being religious, the only factor which seems like it should have any weight in the decision is whether the experience of existence is positive or negative, overall. Assuming that the rational way to behave is to avoid negative experiences and prefer positive ones, I should choose existence if the overall experience is positive, and non-existence if it's negative. But since I can't guarantee whether the experience of existence will be positive or negative, shouldn't I favour non-existence as a rule? At least then I'll be guaranteed no negative experiences, and I won't miss positive ones, since I won't exist.

I should therefore favour ending my existence. But I don't just care about myself, I also care about other people. If I didn't exist, I wouldn't care about them, but while I do exist, the suffering of others is something which influences my decisions. Does this affect my choice? Avoiding suffering by destroying myself would do nothing to lessen the potential suffering of my fellow creatures. If minimising suffering is what I care about, I should favour existence, as at least by existing I will have the capacity to try to help reduce the suffering of others.

But wouldn't the best way of reducing the suffering of others be to kill them too? That way, they could never suffer again. Shouldn't it be my aim, if I'm serious about reducing suffering, to completely eradicate all life and all possibility of life?

But if life was eradicated, there would be nobody around to ensure it didn't arise again, and it might arise in conditions which would make suffering more likely than it is now. Perhaps robots could be built to patrol the universe and disrupt the precursors of life. But what if a completely new form of life arose which the robots weren't capable of recognising? The robots would have to be super-intelligent, in order to recognise such new life. But then, wouldn't the robots themselves be alive? Yes, but they'd be incapable of suffering. But if they were super-intelligent, wouldn't it be wrong to expect them to follow their programming, since this would be a kind of enslavement. No, they would be emotionless, so they wouldn't mind. Also, I don't care about robots. But what if the robots decided the best way to fulfil their mission was to destroy the universe, and they did so, believing that it would stay destroyed, but another universe spontaneously arose in its place, and it was full of suffering? Instead of creating emotionless killer robots, wouldn't it be easier to remove the capacity for suffering from existing lifeforms, or reduce suffering in some other way? Yes.

So this is my justification for existence. The point of existing is to try to alleviate suffering, and it's best achieved by remaining in existence and helping people (and encouraging people to help each other). (If you don't care about the suffering of others, the justification doesn't work)."
"The Mind/Body Problem and Type-Identity TheoryThis is a piece I wrote for my [blog](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/redletteralex) where I cover lots of different things about philosophy and stuff. I just wanted to present it here and get some responses from the community of /r/philosophy  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The mind-body problem is one of the classic problems of philosophy, the modern formulation of which belongs to René Descartes. Simply put, the problem is “how do physical neurological brain states relate to phenomenal mental states?” Descartes tried to solve the problem by saying that the mind and body are not the same and that they are both irreducible primitive substances that have the capacity to influence and cause things in each other. His solution rests on a condition for identity, that is, two things are identical if and only if they share all the same properties. As Descartes defined the mind as a non-extended thinking thing and defined body as an extended non-thinking thing, it follows from his criteria for identity that they cannot by identical for they do not share the same properties. Descartes solution to the problem has a lot of points of contention though. Firstly, how can an immaterial substance (mind) interact with a corporeal substance (body)? According to the Principle of Causal Closure (PCC) all physical effects are entirely exhausted by their physical causes which seems to leave no room for the mind to do any causal work. Moreover, how do we know for certain that the mind is a non-extended thing and how do we know that body is a non-thinking thing? His argument seems to commit the fallacy of the petitio pricinple, that is it begs the question by assuming that mind and body do not have the same properties. Descartes version of substance dualism has long been out of popularity in contemporary philosophy, but it is still widely discussed for its historical importance in setting up the modern day formulation of the mind/body problem.  

During the middle of the 20th century a new solution of the mind body problem arose from the like of philosophers such as U.T. Place and Herbert Feigl. Called the type-identity theory, it proposes that neurological brain states and mental states are not distinct and merely correlated, but they are in fact the same thing, that is, they are identical. An example commonly used is the mental state of being in pain. According to they type identity theory the mental state of being in pain is identical to the neurological state of c-fibers firing. In other words, being in pain just is c-fibers firing. This allows for a dissolution of the causal problem of substance dualism. Mental states have causal efficacy in virtue of being identical to physical brain states. It also allows for a simplification of theories of the mind/brain. Following Occam’s Razor, which states that the simplest explanation is most always the correct one, denying the existence of irreducible physical and mental “stuff” and instead positing only one substance simplifies our picture of the world into a less complex narrative. It is important to realize that this is an ontological thesis about the mind, not a linguistic thesis. Of course we use irreducible mental terms to describe our experience (i.e. “wants”, “desires”, knows”…) but the goal of the project is not to translate these utterances into sentences about synapses, electrons, quarks and the like. The point is that on an ontological level, mental states are identical to physical brain states, regardless of what on the surface our language about mental states and entities implies.  

The type-identity theory of the mind rests on the premise that mental types or kinds are realizable in a one to one correspondence with physical types or kinds. But are we really justified in making this assumption? According to some philosophers such as Hilary Putnam and David Lewis, a singular mental type or kind can be realized by many different physical types or kinds. The argument for this kinda of multiple realizability goes as follows: Say we encounter an alien species that, physiologically, is completely different than humans. Instead of having neural electrical signals for communication from the brain to the rest of the body, this alien species has empty sacs that fill with water or some other fluid. Now lets say we decide to poke at this alien with something sharp. Upon viewing its behavior; it moves away from the stimulus, makes an unpleasant sound, actively avoids the sharp object we poked it with, we would be justified in asserting that the alien is in a state of being in pain. However, since the alien has a vastly different physiology than us, it has no c-fibers to fire, it seems that the same mental type, being in a state of pain, is realized by a physical type that is distinct from c-fibers firing. Since the same mental state of being in pain can be realized by different physical states, it makes sense to say that that mental type is not identical to either physical type, for remember, things are identical if and only if they share all the same properties. If mental states are realizable by many distinct physical states, then it follows that mental states cannot be identical to physical states. This is a powerful objection to the type-identity theory of the mind and has been used to advocate a functionalist theory of mental states.  

Simply put, functionalist theories of the mind assert that mental states are not strictly identical to physical states, but instead can be described by the functional role they play in a larger system. So in our alien example, the mental state of being in pain can be reduced to the functional role it plays in the behavior of the alien, that is, its reaction the being poked with a sharp object. So the mental state of being in pain is described by the causal role it plays by causing other mental states such as the belief that one is in pan, the desire to relieve the pain, the behavior one exhibits when in pain, etc… Any internal state that mediates a similar pattern of causes and effects is pain—regardless of the specific physical mechanisms that mediate the pattern in any given case. Functionalism of the mind works well with comparative neuro-anatomy and physiology between humans and other species as it allows us to keep constant our usages of certain mental predicates such as “being in pain” or “desires” even though the underlying physical mechanism that ground such mental states are physically distinct. Not only is this a logically cohesive idea, it is also grounded in scientific methodology by allowing a sufficiently general schema to capture explanations which seems to be a necessary prescriptive condition for something to be considered a genuine science.  

Notice that functionalist theories of the mind are still physicalist theories of the mind. Physical brain states have ontological primacy in that mental states are dependent on them for their existence, but mental states cannot be fully reduced in a one to one correspondence with brain states. The relationship between the two can be said to be one of supervenience. A cursory definition of supervenience would be that there can be no difference in one without a difference in the other. For example, imagine a set of points in space time that are equidistant from each other so that the set has rotational symmetry. The symmetry of the set of points supervenes on the positions of the individual points; if we move one of the points, the set no longer has symmetry. The symmetry of the set supervenes on the relations between the points in the set such that if we change the position of the points, we no longer have a symmetrical across the set. Notice however that supervenience does not necessarily entail strong reduction. Semantic content of sentences does supervene on syntactical feature of the sentence, but they are not reducible to syntactical feature of the sentence. In much the same way, mental states can be said to supervene on brain states, but are not reducible to brain states.  

Functionalism is a popular position in contemporary philosophy of mind, but that does not mean it is without substantive objections. One possible objection is to deny that similar mental kinds are realized across species. Jaegwon Kim posits that mental kinds are distinct and we must differentiate between “pain-for-a-human” and “pain-for-the-alien”. His argument is an attempt to protect the identity-theory of the mind against multiple realizability arguments. Instead of rendering psychology an autonomous special science, multiple realizability implies that there is no structure-independent scientific psychology. There are only “local” scientific psychologies, each reducible to the theory of the underlying physical mechanisms of the structure-type in question. So the verdict on how successful functionalist theories of the mind are is still out and much great work has been done on the problem in question in the past 30 years. For more reading on the topic I’d recommend the SEP entries on type identity theories of the mind (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/) and multiple realizability (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/) as well as Hilary Putnam’s book Representation and Reality.

"1 - Philosophical foundations and challenges of AIHello everyone, I’m an undergraduate Philosophy student in my third year. I don’t want to explain all my biography, my desire and my beliefs, so I will get straight to the point. I need to write two important essays in english (that is not my first language, being italian) until the 20th of Dicember and, because a mix of my responsability and of an antiquate academic conception in my country, I’ve never write something so important and so “academic” during my undergrad years, expecially in another language. Because so, I’ve decided to dedicate everyday the first two hours of my study routine to the topic where I’m interested to and I’ve decided to do so following the “rules” of the deliberate practice, studying, writing and thinking acitvely on what I read and looking for constant feedbacks. The topics that I’ve choosed (that are my favourite philosophical topics overall) are the philosophies of Artificial Intelligence, of Cognitive Science and of Mind. Every Sunday I would like to report here a summary of the progress of my studies, trying to explain the basics concepts of the topics that I’ve choose based on my notes and hoping to start a debate on it with other philosophy addicted like me. I’m not an expert, I am not (yet) a Reddit assiduous frequentator, I’m not (yet) a good academic writer and I’m not a native english speaker, so keep in mind these premises when you read my posts. That said, I hope that my posts will be useful as an introduction and as a starting point for a deeper understanding of this crucial issues. 

Ps. These are firsts three books that I have planned to study.

- Artificial Intelligence: The Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intellingence, Keith Frankish and William M. Ramsey (editors)
- Cognitive Science: The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science, Keith Frankish and William M. Ramsey (editors)
- Philosophy of Mind: Philosophy of Mind, Jaegwon Kim

Introduction

The claim of this analysis is to approach the techincal field of the Artificial Intelligence from a philosophical point of view, so without programming or complex mathematical prerequisites. I’m going to be schematic and brief as much as I can, writing here my notes on this book and, for now, more questions that answers, hoping to go deeper in the following weeks thanks also to the comments and discussions. If you noted an error in my style, grammar or in the nature of what I write, please let me know and I’ll correct it as soon as I can, if I agree with your correction.

A definition of Artificial Intelligence is complex. I’ve tryied to do that and this is my answer:

- Artificial Intelligence is a) an inorganic agent capable of creative adaptation in different formal or informal context (obejct definition) and b) the studying of the possible implementation strategies of an inorganic intelligent agent (field definition)

Some important questions raised by the field of the Artificial Intelligence are:

- Can a machine think? What does it mean to “think”? Is it possible that exist some differences between different “thinking agent” (a moral agent, a live agent, an organic agent, an intelligent agent, etc.)? 
- Wich is the difference between a Strong AI (an Artificial Intelligence that is identical to a Biological Intelligence) and a -- - Weak AI (an Artificial Intelligence that act like a Biological Intelligence but that is not identical to that)?
- What are the metaphisical assumptions beyond the very idea of the AI? 
- What theory of mind and of psychology fit the best with the ideas at the foundation of the AI? 
- What ethical concerns are raised by the possible emergence of some AI?

1 - Core themes

Some of the most important of AI distinctions, issues, themes and controversies:

- Smart software vs cognitive modeling. Which is the best way to implement an AI, to create and intelligent software that are indipendent from the only intelligence that we know (ours) or to model this softwers on our cognitive functions? To postulate that this difference is inconsistent is to assume that Intelligence is a function indipendent from the material world and to postulate the opposite is to assume an identity between intelligence and the phisycal substratum of the box in which this intelligence is situated (our brain). 

- Symbolic AI vs Neural Nets. Is it possible to reach the AI building a software based on the manipulation of the formal symbols structure of the human thinking or do we focus our attention to the implementation of a model of our brain?

- Reasoning vs Perception. Do we have to build an AI that simulate the thinking process indipendently from the perception or is it necessary that a machine have an internal system of interpretation of the sensory stimulus? 

- How much is important that a machine have the capacity to rapresent the knowledge because we define it sensient and intelligent?

- Brain in a vat vs Embodied AI. Problem aparently solved: the claim was if is it necessary to built a machine that act intelligently but without being embodied in some perceptual system (like the Turing Machine) or if this machine have to interact with the surrounding world directly. The researches, now, are focused on the embodied AI.

- Narrow AI vs human-level intelligence. Is it possible to implement a Strong AI (that IS like the human brain) or is it only possible to built a Weak AI (that ACT intelligently, but that is different from the human intelligence)?

2 - Philosophical foundation and challenges

An important question: does an AI have to simulate the high level cognitive processes of the human brain (logic, deduction, inference, symbols manipulation, etc) or is it better to built first a bottom-up system that start to learn this processes from the lower level perceptual abilities? The first claim is the one supported by the GOFAI view (Good Old Fashon AI): they prefer the faster way, that is to model the best system of intelligence that we know, ours. The second is the one supported by the Embodied AI: we have to build an evolutionary system, starting from the creation of a basic simulation af an artificial organism and following it during its evolution.

The Turing Test was the first attempt to imagine how we can determine if a machine is intelligent or not: it postulate that we can understand if a system is intelligent or not just by an evaluation of its linguisti ability and of its behaviour. This is the behavioural-GOFAI vision of the AI. A new version of the Turin Test postulate that we have to integrate to this two criteria the ability of this machine to interact with the surrounding ambient. This is the vision of the Embodied AI.

It is a general belief that an AI could not think abductively, namely it could not generate conjections from some premises. This creative way of thinking is claimed to be one of the higher human ability, and who follow this argument think that a machine that could only follow a set of rules cannot think outside this rules and formulate new conjecture. This is the problem of relevance: a machine seem to couldn’t have an olistic approrach to reality, so that is impossible for her to understand when an information is relevant or when it is not. But what does it mean that only an embodied system could act intelligently? Is it maybe that there is a necessary relation between the body and the function?

Computational theory of mind. This theory is based on the assumption that when an agent think he follow a set of basic and atomic blocks of meaning, that are symbols that one could reproduce in an algorithmic system. Mental states, so, are just a composition of different blocks of meaning. But what is the foundation of this blocks? How can we have this language of thought? Is it based on what? Three possible answers of these questions: 1) informational theory: if a quantity of x change in the same time of a quantity of y so this two quantity are related; so if a mental state change when in brain there is a changing in the quantity of y the mental state is related to the brain changes; 2) evolutive theory: mental state are adaptation, useful to survive, and the meaning associated to these state are only evolution tricks for surviving; 3) conceptual-role semantics: the meaning of a linguistic fact is based on the social meaning associated to this fact. 

A critic to the Turing test: it is possible that someone build a Turing machine that seem to be intelligent because speak like an human, but it speek like that only because someone program it in that way. It could seem similare to the old argument of Lady Lovelace: one could program a machine to talk an human language but this machine could only follow the rules programmed by the programmer, never become conscious of the real meaning of the language that it speak (the Searle’s Chinese Room Argument say a similar thing, and I’m going to talk of that in a specific topic)

What is the relation between purpouse/intentionality/consciousness and AI? It could be that someone built a machine that have a mental state (AI)Purpose' correspondent to (Human)Purpose, relating a vast range of (AI)IntentionalMentalState' to (Human)IntentionalMentalState. Searle reject this view arguing that a Machine could only posses a sintax, not a semantic (meaning that a robot have an algoritmic language and human have a non-deterministic language?).

Difference between mechanism and rationality: beeing rational mean to act according to some (general) rules, beeing mechanic mean to act according to some instruction taht could violate the general rules. This is a reproposition of the problem of relevance: a rational beeing could understand when an information is relevant under the light of some evidences indipendently of the instruction, whereas a mechanical engine could only understand what someone told him to be relevant.

The godelian argument is very complex, but I understand something: any formal system is proved by Godel to be inconsistent or incomplete and being a mechanism based on some type of a formal system, one coud conclude that an AI is to be incomplete or inconsistent. The problem is that following this argument one could doubt the godelian theorem himself, because it is based on the thinking of another formal system, the mind of a mathematician."
"What is consciousness, and what does it mean to be a conscious entity?As I read more and more about the philosophical ramifications that the exponential growth of science and technology will have on humanity, I find myself thinking more and more about these questions.  Science and technology may not seem to be the subjects that would lead one to questions of consciousness, but when one reads about the exponential growth of computational technologies the bridge between the two, seemingly distinct, subjects is formed.
	We take for granted that we human beings are conscious.  Some people may extend the honor to some animals such as dolphins, some apes, blue whales, and elephants because of their family structures, advanced communication systems, and prolonged adolescent periods, but this could be explained as a product of evolution, being that homo sapiens are rather closely related to some of these organisms, but the question that I am more interested in is if entities that are not of an organic nature could be considered to be conscious.  Could an advanced computer that can think in a manner equal to that of a human mind be considered conscious?  I understand that this question is not the exact one that I posed in my title, but I feel that if we can answer one then we can answer the other.
	Consciousness is loosely defined as the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself; it is subjectivity, awareness, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood and the executive control system of the mind.  This is an adequate definition, but it leaves out the answer to one very important question: where does consciousness reside?  
	The location of one entity’s consciousness may seem like an odd question.  One may be tempted to equate it to the question of where the soul resides, but this question forces one to more clearly define what consciousness is.  
	One might say that the consciousness, like the theological or spiritual soul, resides within the heart (i.e. body) and mind, but as a material realist I find fault with this.  How can the consciousness be directly tied to one’s physical self?  By the age of twenty the majority of a person’s cells are not the same cells that he or she was born with and all of the atoms that make up his or her body, including the brain’s atoms, have been replaced many times.  Our bodies are simply a pattern.  To say that the consciousness has any connection to the physical body is to assert that there is some abstract essence that constitutes a conscious.  I find this to be a baseless assertion.  
	So this brings us to the brain.  The brain, like the body, is also a mere pattern, but it is this organ that thinks, and therefore, the consciousness, all of one’s thoughts, memories, and instincts, is a product of the brain.  This is important to note because the brain is mechanical.  Thinking is the product of electric pulses between neuron connections.  This is why it is possible to create a computer that works in the same manner as the human brain, and due to the Law of Increasing Returns this possibility will soon be a reality, so if consciousness resides in the brain why can’t a nonorganic being (i.e. a computer or “robot”) be conscious?
	The future holds more than just computers that will be equal to and quickly surpass human thinking capabilities.  In Ray Kurzweil’s book The Age of Spiritual Machines he writes about the exponential evolution of technologies, but he also writes that 

“A more challenging but also ultimately feasible scenario will be to scan someone’s brain to map the location, interconnections, and contents of the somas, axons, dendrites, presynaptic vesicles, and other neural components.  Its entire organization could then be re-created on a neural computer of sufficient capacity including the contents of its memory.”

	If this is possible, then what does it say about consciousness?  Kurzweil is talking about taking everything that is in the brain, not just the memories and the instincts, but everything, and downloading it on to a machine of some sort.  If consciousness if the culmination of one’s thoughts then this mechanical device would possess a consciousness, and if this machine also has the ability to think in a manner that allows it to carry on thought based on information gained from the brain scan would this machine not represent the continuity of the original person’s consciousness?  This question leads us to two other distinct questions.  Is life a requirement for and entity to be conscious?  Would these machines be considered alive?
	The second question that I proposed may seem radical, but Mr.Kurzweil does a splendid job of putting such a question into context.  In The Age of Spiritual Machines he writes that

 “Up until now, our morality was tied to the longevity of our hardware.  When the hardware crashed, that was it.  For many of our forebears, the hardware gradually deteriorated before it disintegrated…As we cross the divide to instantiate ourselves into our computational technology, our identity will be based on our evolving mind file.  We will be software, not hardware.
As software, our morality will no longer be dependent on the survival of the computing circuitry.  There will still be hardware and bodies, but the essence of our identity will switch to the permanence of our software.”

I know that I have posed more questions than my title implied, but I hope I was clear in my inquiry and my personal opinions.  I truly wish to hear other people’s thoughts on this subject.

How massive parallelism lifts the brain’s performance above that of AI.
"Humans and Artificial Intelligence Can't Form Real Friendships (Yet). Can humans and artificially intelligent robots form friendships? To explore this question, the term 'friendship’ must be defined. Many definitions of friendship are inspired by Greek philosopher Aristotle. He argues that friendships are characterized by the utility and pleasure that can be gained from a relationship, as well as the sharing of virtues and ideals. These criteria may seem to convey that friendships are motivated by self-interest. However, while the principles of utility and pleasure imply that friendships are founded on self-interest, the final principle of virtue sharing lies in the benefits they bestow on the participants. They aren’t necessarily mutually enriching. The final principle of virtue sharing conveys that friendships are different from other kinds of relationships because they require mutual benefit.

To examine if humans can form friendships with inanimate objects that emulate human life, two cases will be presented to establish a concrete example of how humans can form relationships with inanimate objects that resemble human life. The first case involves a man from Michigan who is married and claims to have a mistress, although neither of them are human. They are synthetic, robotic dolls. The man from Michigan promotes love with artificial beings and claims that they are happy together.

The second case involves a military bomb-disposal robot that was destroyed on a battlefield in Iraq. He was given a formal military funeral and was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star medallion. The soldiers working with the robot felt they owed him the respect of proper military recognition. The soldiers claim that the robot developed a personality of its own and he had saved their lives on many occasions.

These kinds of experiences are not exceedingly uncommon and illustrate the notion that humans can form powerful emotional attachments to non-living objects, especially if they resemble humans or human behavior. Even simple, non-living objects such as photographs of loved ones that have passed away can carry strong emotional sediment. Concerning robots, humans can certainly fulfill Aristotle’s criteria of utility and pleasure from machines, as their creation is meant to fulfill these very purposes. However, to determine whether a robot benefits from a relationship with a human, the desires of the robot should be examined. Robots don’t seem to possess any desires at all. They are machines devoid of free will. Therefore, in their current state, robots can’t fulfill Aristotle’s notion of virtue sharing and mutual benefit.

The developments of ‘artificial intelligence’ are meant to fulfill the theory of computer systems being able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. The question of if friendships can ever truly be formed between humans and robots is reliant on determining if robots can ever become truly alive, which suggests that robots would possess free will, their own desires, and autonomy. The criteria and classification of life according to leading modern secular thought are as follows: “All life is highly ordered and structured; all life reproduces itself; all life grows and develops to reach maturity; all life takes in and utilizes energy to carry out the functions of its components, which results in growth and development; all living things exhibit homeostasis; all living things respond to their environment by sensing external stimuli and changing their body to fulfill a behavior; and, finally, all living things adapt to external pressures, and evolve because of them.”

While this list of characteristics may be incomplete or contested by various demographics, such as religious groups or other such conflicting philosophies, it can be argued that artificial intelligence will soon be able to accomplish all of these characteristics, as programs such as viruses are already able to proliferate, reproduce, utilize energy, and so forth. In light of this prediction, robots should then be assessed as to whether they truly experience a desire to form a friendship with a human and recognize any mutual benefits. So long as artificial intelligence functions by a set of behaviors originated by their initial programming, it can be argued that robots can never satisfy this mutually satisfying condition because robots can never have truly autonomous free will. They wouldn't truly express desires, as they don’t have their own values or beliefs. In this sense, the characteristics of life in a robot could be thought of as deceptions that mislead us as to the true nature of the robot. In this sense, a higher form of life capable of forming friendships can be characterized by free will and autonomy, as well as the conventional characteristics of life.

In conclusion, so long as robots obey a set of behaviors as determined by computer programming rather than the innate mechanisms that bring forth free will and autonomy, this essay concludes that the developments of artificial intelligence is not currently sufficient for humans to develop ‘friendships’ with robots, according to Aristotle's definition of friendship. The driving force that compels humans to possess free will and autonomy currently seem to be incompatible with the driving forces of artificial intelligence that emulate life. The criterion of mutual benefaction isn’t fulfilled. The emotional attachments humans feel towards robots perhaps could instead be classified by other forms of relationships rather than ‘friendship’."
"Civilization is the original cause of ecocideI recently read a text called [It’s Not Capitalism that’s Driving Ecocide; it’s Civilization](https://macskamoksha.com/2019/12/not-capitalism), written by Kollibri terre Sonnenblume, and I decided to write something about it. I agree that it is not only capitalism that is driving ecocide and that colonialist society has been doing this since long before. By the title, some people may think that he is saying that capitalism is not a problem, which would be wrong since the text states that “capitalism cannot be reformed and must be dismantled”.

The central point of the text should be read as a question: is it possible to reconcile Marxism and environmentalism? Although eco-socialists guarantee it is, there are some complications to be solved, especially when considering concepts such as “human supremacy”, or anthropocentrism. And with that I am not saying that movements like Earth First are more coherent. I am not in a position to make this assessment.

The problem is that much of ecology and socialism is anthropocentric. Most ecologists and eco-socialists do not criticize civilization. Part of eco-anarchism understands this criticism because it has opened up to other ecological perspectives. The State also cannot be reformed and must be dismantled. The ecological crisis makes capitalism even more contradictory, but the civilizing contradiction has been present since the foundation of class society: the opposition between human beings and other beings.

The question is: how far can eco-socialism go in its critique of the human domain over nature? To reflect on this, we can start by thinking about the [words](https://www.correio24horas.com.br/noticia/nid/vida-sustentavel-e-vaidade-pessoal-diz-ailton-krenak/) of Ailton Krenak : “I put in question whether there is anything possible to think of as sustainable in the urban and modern way of life that we share in various places (…). What activity can be sustainable within such a system? ”

If civilization started ecocide long before capitalism, how can the end of capitalism itself put an end to ecocide? Is a socialist, ecological and sustainable civilization possible?

Continuing with Krenak’s reflection, “food production is certainly not sustainable”. The agricultural revolution (also called the Neolithic revolution) is considered a major advance in human history, as well as the green revolution (use of new technologies to increase agricultural production, starting in the 1960s). But both were disastrous for nature and human life. Biotechnology represents a next step in the same direction, while agroecology promises to reverse the devastating effects of these “revolutions”, turning agriculture into a sustainable practice.

But let us consider sustainability as a myth, or “as a narrative that was created by corporations to continue winning over consumers with the idea that what you are consuming is produced in a sustainable way, but it is a lie”. In this sense, how to know if agroecology is really sustainable?

Even with the most ecological agriculture in the world, it is possible that “the numbers don’t match”, as Krenak says. This is because the needs we have now do not correspond to the naturally sustainable needs for human beings. These are needs created by civilization, which would never be possible without a way of life based on patriarchy, exploitation, accumulation, expansion, invasion, slavery, genocide, epistemicide and ecocide. If in fact “the infrastructure that exists in cities is going to collapse” and “all the attempts in the world to regulate consumption, production, distribution of goods are unsustainable”, what to do?

Well, we know what not to do. We cannot continue to assume the same premises that it is enough to end the waste generated by capitalism, or invest in scientific and technological advances that aim at the common good (of humanity) instead of the profit of companies. This may still be insufficient. Technology gives us extraordinary powers. Can we use all these great powers produced by our techno-scientific “advancement” for the good of all species and the planet as a whole? Is this humanly possible? Is this possible without anthropocentrism or human exceptionalism?

It is necessary to understand that “we are making wrong choices”. Not just capitalists, but we have all been making the wrong choices for a long, long time. Can we assume all the responsibility that comes with the powers granted by technological development? Environmentalists in general do not criticize the technology or the urban way of life itself. On the contrary, they are talking about sustainable cities and green technology. But what if an urban and technological way of life is actually a “trap”, something inherently unsustainable?

Krenak’s proposal is a human society that leaves no trace of its passage through the land. “We leave too much trace and every culture that leaves a trace is unsustainable.” The heart of this idea, for me, goes unnoticed by most people: that we are only passing through here. Not only us as individuals, but humanity as a whole is only here temporarily. That is, humanity needs to have an end. Civilization is, in many ways, the denial of an end. Our culture didn’t lose it’s way, it didn’t become unsustainable due to change in it’s course. It has been unsustainable since the beginning.

We are alienated “in relation to the origin of everything we eat, drink, wear”. But we are also alienated in relation to disposal, that is, the final destination of everything we eat, drink, dress, and even our own final destination. Our way of life, our consumption and our very existence has become unsustainable. That is why trying to be individually “more sustainable” is a “personal vanity”. We won’t change anything if we don’t change everything.

The idea that you can save the planet by doing your part creates “a psychological environment that hides the real reason” of the ecological crisis. The way we are living, in a more fundamental sense than just the economic system, is the cause of the ecological crisis. But we are led to believe that there is no other way to live, since we are in the most “advanced” way, and since we cannot “go back” or “revert time”.

There are other ways to live, but as Krenak says, some of them are “racist and elitist, they suggest that the rich are the ones who know how to live in the world”. This phrase can be reinterpreted in several ways: they suggest that whites are the ones who know how to live in the world. Or the people who created the industrial revolution. Or the people who have created empires. They are the people who created a way of life based on the intensive use of animals and soil. You see? Civilization invented class and poverty.

Can we prevent industrial processes from draining our water? In other words, can we prevent civilization from destroying the world? To cite one of the most difficult problems: how to abandon the use of fossil fuel? As Krenak says, “fossil fuel should have been abandoned in the 1990s”. We knew we had to stop, but we didn’t. Why is it going to be different now?

The hope for a sustainable civilization holds a belief, a modern mythology, which is the “idea of ​​self-sufficiency” of humanity. We believe that everything is possible if we strive. A better system is enough. “With the advancement of what has been called civilization, and with the advent of globalization, this thinking has taken over the entire planet,” says Krenak. Civilization has always tried to be sustainable, and it has always failed to do so. I repeat: why would it be different in a post-capitalist civilization?

The urban experience took us away from nature. The simplicity of this phrase is misleading. Being away from nature is not just not knowing how to live without a refrigerator and a stove. It means, first of all, not remembering WHO you are and what you are doing HERE. “Many values ​​that we have, that we think are fundamental to humanity, have been created and have been instilled in our culture, in our mentality”. They are not values ​​of humanity, they are values ​​of a culture that denies humanity, because it denies nature. Just as it denies life, because it denies death.

This “memory loss” is a central concept. When the poet says “people are not bad, they are just lost”, he reflects an ancestral idea. When someone happened to do something wrong, the other members of the community would come together to REMEMBER that person of the good things they did, that is, make them remember WHO THEY ARE.

Thus, the central question for criticizing ecocide is not: “how to be sustainable”, but “who are we?”, or even, “what is the human being?”. It doesn’t seem like a very pragmatic question, you can protest that we need more action and less philosophy. However, adherence to this silent and unquestioned philosophy of civilization is what brought us to this nightmare.

That is why I consider it so important that Krenak decides to talk about “worldview”, and more specifically, the worldview that “the Earth is a living organism”. This should not be interpreted as a metaphor. It is not about treating the Earth “as if” it were a living organism. If the Earth is really a living organism, everything that civilization has understood about the world is wrong, because all civilized knowledge is based on the objectification of the natural world.

Global warming is just Earth’s fever. It is not the disease itself, but a symptom. Traditional environmentalists focus on treating the symptom, but how to treat the disease? How to diagnose the disease?

The human being is able to survive if left naked in the forest, but is not capable of causing much damage to the environment. To destroy its habitat, it is necessary to create special tools and techniques for this, which have nothing to do with the need for survival. The cultures that did not create these devices “are not engaged in planetary consumption”. If these peoples are the “medicine”, in Krenak’s words, who or what is the disease? As he says, “there are people left outside this civilizing circle who still know, still reflect on a worldview, are protected by this memory and are still capable of thinking other worlds and building other world perspectives”. This suggests that we, civilized, like those who have forgotten who they are, are stuck in a single way of thinking and building the world. Our vision is restricted. The weight of the technical system that we created to change the world as we see fit can be impossible to carry, unsustainable in a deeper sense of the word.

Civilizing techno-culture “is fascinating”, but also “a poison”. “Everyone becomes dependent on this great embrace of the world for apparent human needs.” It is an addiction, as Kollibri also says. Now imagine how difficult it is to get rid of a collective addiction that has dominated us for thousands of years… Of course it seems utopian. But at the same time, nothing could be more unrealistic than staying in that addiction. As it should be clear, the greatest damage of this addiction is not exactly to the Earth, but to the human spirit. In the same way, he who weighs heavily on the life of his own family does more damage to his own self-esteem than to his family.

We have not been able to remove this burden from our conscience. We are experiencing a “dissociation” between human experience and the planet. However, we do not destroy the world without knowing what we are doing. We use all our intelligence in this project. Necrocivilization, to make a parallel with necrocapitalism, placed us in a simulated world, in which we like to be. It makes us pretend that everything is going to be okay, when it obviously isn’t. Obviously the damage we do to the world cannot be simply erased. Like a lie that has been kept at all costs, the consequences of admitting the truth are now necessarily disastrous for us.

“We were converted to an idea of ​​humanity that is not real. It is a post-humanity ”, says Krenak. The humanity that we try to realize cannot come true. The attempt to realize this ideal, running over others, is the civilizing process, “it is the core of colonial thought”. The concepts of civilization and humanity that we use are impregnated with coloniality. “Colonialism says: let’s modernize, let’s civilize, let’s humanize”. The way out is not to colonize other planets, but to know yourself.

How far have traditional critics of capitalism dared to go on the journey “into ourselves”? How much have you questioned what has been considered humanly necessary, and how much have you simply accepted the civilized historical process as if it told the story of mankind?

The heart of the criticism of anthropocentrism can be summed up in the following sentence by Krenak: “The problem is when we think that we are the only life here, to the point that, when the basis for this continuity here is not enough, we will reproduce elsewhere”. This leads me again to the denial of the limit, the inevitable end of life. Everything that begins has an end. But the anthropocentric concept of sustainability does not see an end for humanity. Even when the ecological perspective considers itself ecocentric or biocentric, it does not think about human existence within a cycle with a beginning, middle and end. It wants to bargain for the continuity of the scheme.

New minds, on the other hand, no longer want the scheme to continue. “This is what boys and girls are doing, they are telling the world that adults falsify a narrative about the world, and they don’t want to.” Mild autists have an advantage in realizing this. As a friend recently made me think, civilization created an exclusive language to think the world, a neurotypical or “normal” language, which excludes the natural diversity of ways of thinking, because this diversity is not efficient for the production of a civilizing project. It is common for people with neuroatypical mental structures to have difficulty understanding social and communication rules, as they do not seem to make any sense. We are forced to repress a part of ourselves in order to become “functional”, and this usually comes with a feeling of acting like a robot. In a way, it is exactly how anyone feels in civilization, in some degree. This only goes unnoticed when their performance is more easily accepted by society. “Normal” minds forget what it is like to think outside the box that civilization puts us, but “different” minds cannot forget, because they are terrible actors.

That is why tolerance or living with the different is not enough. An “alternation” is needed. Alternation implies knowing how to pass the ball, and also knowing when to leave, rest, stop, give up. Come back later, who knows. The majority of men who feel threatened by feminism have difficulty precisely in this point: they do not know how to lose. They believe that all the weight of a ancient oppressive structure can be dissipated with a policy of women “participation” in the same schemes that the patriarchy created, without displacing or disturbing them in any way. In other words, they believe in the “continuity of the scheme”. As if things need not to weigh for men. This would only be possible if patriarchy had not produced privileges. It is never easy to lose privileges and comforts, but sometimes it is necessary.

This should not be read as an apology for catastrophism or paralyzing pessimism, or worse, a connivance with a system of discarding people. But it’s hard not to look like a sadist when you have bad news to give. I do not intent to “tell the truth and run”. I intent to help whoever is receiving the message to be able to bear it. It takes courage to give up certain addictions. But perhaps what is holding us is of a different nature, something much more difficult to abandon.

I return to the main question here: are environmentalists willing to lose in the name of alternating with the Other? Judging by the mainstream ecological discourse, the answer would be no. I could cite an example: “I do not agree that more progress will be made by appealing to people’s hearts than to their wallets,” says ecological economist Robert Constanza, founder of the International Society for Ecological Economics, the main reference in ecological economics. It seems too romantic to say that it is precisely the heart, and not the reason, that can save us now. If it is true that human action always seeks comparative advantage, the worldview presented here has no chance. However, if it makes any sense, the economy as a whole needs to be questioned, not just the liberal economy, but our whole self-image as “rational beings”.

Eco-capitalism wants to put a price on nature in order to protect it. Eco-socialism wants collective ownership of the means of production (as a final objective) and more effective state regulation of the economy (as a more immediate objective) to protect nature. As Kollibri suggests, eco-capitalism is much easier to refute. Eco-socialism, however, is much more complex to answer. This is because, although it can be properly ecological, it is not exactly “sustainable”. How so?

The answer, for me, begins in this speech by Krenak: “In some cultures, the idea of ​​falling is within the cycle of existence. It articulates with the idea of ​​the seed, which buries itself, dies and becomes the tree and gives more seed, and fruit, and becomes seed, and buries again. Cycles”. Our Judeo-Christian culture, however, sees the fall as a problem. We do not want to fall, we are special, we are destined for a special place, where no one else dies and no one else falls. And because we don’t want to fall, we can’t be really sustainable, because we deny alternation. The life cycle includes death. We do not want the end of civilization, we want to avoid the collapse of this economic model based on cities that contemplate eternity. We want to use the techniques, knowledge, science and technology created in and for civilization to prevent the fall and build a supposedly advanced, and supposedly human, world. Instead, we should accept the consequences of an immeasurable accumulation of wrong decisions. Decisions so wrong that they can no longer be corrected. We need to learn to drop and fall. Can we do it, or is civilized power too tempting?"
"Critique my explanation for why Free Will isn't plausibleThird Draft (Same as Second with Add-on)

Preface: I'm referring to the monotheistic idea of Free Will: That we act independently of the laws of nature and the preceding series of events that go back to the Big Bang.  

My Motivation: The Christian God, for example, judges us for our sins.  The issue I see with this is he, presumably, made the universe and therefore he 'wrote the script' to all of the actions we'll take in our lives.  I'd even argue that he's responsible for those sins.   

If I had the knowledge of Laplace's Demon (Everything in universe) and I created a robot, knowing it would commit heinous acts in reaction to future circumstances, I'm responsible for those actions because I KNEW, arguably even intended (why else would I create the robot with this knowledge), creating this specific robot would lead to it doing such things.

**Argument against Free Will**
*All credit to /u/Fibonacci35813 for his well articulated philosophical arguments* 
P1: The behavior of all matter is determined by antecedent condition together with the natural laws and cause and effect.
P2: Humans (and subsequently their brains and body) are made up of matter.
P3: Thoughts and behavior are the function of the brain and the body.
C: Thoughts and behavior are the function of antecedent condition together with the natural laws and cause and effect.
Now, one might question the first premise and argue that some matter is probabilistic or perhaps even random.
Ok, so here is an additional premise:
P1b - If matter is not determined by antecedent condition together with the natural laws and cause and effect, then it is determined by probablisitc determinism and/or randomness.
But then you get the conclusion:
Cb: Thoughts and behavior are the function of randomness or probabilistic determinism.

Further Elaboration: If we're composed of matter, we're subject to the laws of nature.  We haven't come far enough in neuroscience to predict someone's behavior from the state of each individual, of roughly 100 billion, neuron.  We do know, however, that neurons are composed of atoms.  We also know atoms act according to physical laws.  We know that what each atom does at any given time is determined from the beginning of the universe.  We know that if we knew the state of every atom in the universe in one frame of time, then we can predict the state of every atom in the universe at ANY other frame of time in the future and similarly calculate the state of every atom in the universe at ANY other frame of time in the past.  That means with such knowledge, we could know the state of everything emergent from atomic physics, including the state of our bodies and the emergent processes of our bodies, our minds.  We'd be able to know this because every state of the universe is brought about by the prior state.  Here's a simple example, you know a meteor flying through space is travelling at 8000 m/s in a given direction and there's no matter anywhere remotely close enough to affect this meteor in any way, you can then predict a second from now that meteor will be 8000 meters, in that given direction, from where it was a second ago because its state a second ago determined its state a second in the future.  You can complicate this scenario all you want, if you knew all the parameters of its state and the laws of physics you'd know where it was at any time before and any time thereafter.  

Humans are incredibly complicated. There's roughly 100 billion neurons interacting in the brain, there's 5 ways for the brain to collect information on the current physical circumstances (our senses), and those neurons interpret that information and compute an output not just on current circumstances but past circumstances stored, however accurately (not perfect), within certain neurons.  You deactivate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and your behavior changes because your brain can no longer inhibit the influence emotional information has on the computations for behavior.  You deactivate any other part of the brain and you have similar results: behavior changes.  Deactivating the amygdala for example, results in fear and memories of fear no longer being calculated into behavior.  There's an interaction between the Dorsal Raphe Nuclei and the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex that makes us feel we have control over a situation that, if interrupted, make us feel as though there's no possible escape: The elephant tied to a wooden stake planted in the ground never tries to escape even though they could easily force their way free.  Similarly, if you put a rat in a hamster wheel that doesn't deactivate shocks being delivered to its tail through rotation, then place that same rat in a hamster wheel that deactivates those shocks upon rotation, that rat, in most cases, doesn't even attempt to rotate the wheel.  Now, these are simple, macroscopic level experiments, but imagine if we manipulated which neurotransmitters bind to each receptor site of each individual neuron of the 100 billion along with the exterior circumstances and memories of a human.  Also, Imagine you designed the DNA of this human and knew all the epigenetic factors and how to manipulate them.  You could then, likely, control their every action.  

Add-On:  Now, I can say with high probability, there are people with higher IQ's than I, that believe in Libertarian free will. However, what I noticed in many responses is a lack of understanding of the very essential and, I'd argue, necessary concept of emergence. I mean, without understanding emergence, you simply cannot hope to grasp many of the more complicated questions of reality.

Firstly, what is emergence? To quote Sean Carroll, ""the idea that there are multiple theories/languages/vocabularies/ontologies that we can use to usefully describe the world, each appropriate at different levels of coarse-graining and precision."" 

What does he mean by 'different levels of coarse-graining and precision'? An example relevant to my free will argument would be 'biology is at a more coarsely-grained level than chemistry and atomic physics is at a more precise level than chemistry.' This is to say 'biology is at a level emergent from the level chemistry occupies which is emergent from the level of atomic physics'. 

Why is this important to understanding reality? Well, for example, someone might say 'a total understanding of atomic physics tells you NOTHING about how the brain works (neuroscience)'. In fact, many if not most people reason exactly like that. Well, you'd be correct to say 'a total understanding of atomic physics does not give us a total understanding of how the brain works'. However, it DOES tell us some ways in which the brain CAN'T work.

Okay so with a complete theory of atomic physics, Core Theory, given the overwhelming probability it's correct, what can we derive to be a false idea about how the brain works? The brain cannot function independent of the universe. If the brain cannot function independent of the universe then there is no possibility for libertarian free will, which is, to quote John Hendrix, ""the ability to perform some other action in place of the one that is actually done"". So when you make a choice, you could NOT have made any other choice. There's a logical scenario where libertarian free will can exist: The atoms that compose the human brain do not abide by the laws of physics. I can't disprove this. I can point to the lack of a good reason to believe it any more than that reality is an illusion and that '2+2=4' is illogical, which are equally empirically unlikely. 

What about compatabilism? Compatabilism is certainly plausible, but that's because it only proposes the emergent IDEA of free will. I'd argue that compatabilists are talking about something different than libertarians and determinists. In fact, a determinist that understands emergence, would probably say the compatabalist version of Free Will, to once again quote Sean Caroll, ""is as real as baseball"". Baseball is certainly real, but it's certainly not as fundamental as biology. In fact, the idea of free will is probably a function of consciousness which is a function of the brain and if you find that hard to swallow because you're , unfortunately, of the popular opinion that we know NOTHING about consciousness and that it's this huge unsolvable mystery, do some web surfing for neuroscience studies on consciousness and I guarantee you, your opinion will shift to 'there's more we don't know than do know but there are some things that we know'.

One study I think is relevant to this topic of free will is Libet's study on voluntary actions. The action potential cascading to the subsequent action occurred .55 seconds before the action. The 'decisive' thought for this action occurred .2 seconds before the action; that's .35 seconds after the action was bound to occur. Sounds a lot like the action was computed and THEN we thought and felt we chose it and THEN the action was done.    

            "
"Defeating the ""what about humans?"" argument for veganismMany people have effectively argued that we shouldn't eat meat from factory farms or other farms where animals are raised in bad conditions. For the purposes of this post I'll just assume this position.

But some go further and argue that it is wrong even to raise an animal for food in a good environment. Even if its life is good with positive well-being, it's still wrong to create such animals, therefore animal farming is always wrong. This doesn't make a lot of sense on its face: it's *good for* the animal, it has a *happy* life, how can it be wrong to kill it? But the vegans have a defense: imagine if they did this to humans. Would you support raising humans and then killing them for food? Of course not! It's barbaric! And so the vegan wins the argument.

There is one line of response to this which says that humans deserve rights which animals don't. Even though both animals and humans are moral patients, and both deserve not to suffer unnecessarily, humans (and whatever rare or hypothetical animals happen to have human-like levels of rational thinking, social standing, cognition, etc) also have special rights not to be raised and slaughtered. Thus, it's consistent to say that it's wrong to farm humans but not wrong to (humanely) farm animals.

That's one response, which I won't go into here. Agree or disagree with it at your leisure. Instead I will show how we can respond to the vegan argument while preserving a fully welfare-oriented perspective. And the first way to do that is to simply deny the assumption that farming humans would be wrong.

We can take it for granted that doing this in *reality* doesn't make sense: there would be too many social problems, it would be extremely economically inefficient, etc. Even if we allowed, say, consenting parents to produce and slaughter an infant, that would generate enough pure outrage and family tension to far outweigh the minor nutritional and gustatory benefits. 

However, let's imagine a world where people can be raised for food and it actually 'works'. E.g., suppose that aliens have watch over the Earth and they beam people away for euthanasia as they get older, something universal and predictable just like natural old age death. And suppose the aliens had planted humans on Earth just for this purpose. Is that better than Earth being an empty world? To me, it seems like it is better. I would rather live on such a world than have no life at all. 

Also, there is no need to restrict our focus to meat. Humans (and animals) could be raised and sacrificed for a wide number of things. For instance, it could be for organs - which I think we can commonly agree is no different from being raised and sacrificed for meat, except for the fact that organs are more important (they could save lives).

More interestingly, humans could be raised for sacrifice in other ways. Imagine that you are a Star Wars clone trooper who is tasked with guarding a robotic mining operation on another planet. Your job is for economic purposes rather than saving people's lives, you could be killed instantly by a surprise strike (suppose it is inevitable given enough time), but until then you have a decent life, almost no labor and enjoy just hanging around. Is it wrong that the mining company had you cloned, even as you are personally glad for it? I don't see this as the case. Of course, you might prefer an *even better* life (don't we all), but that doesn't change the basic fact that your life is better than nonexistence. Alternatively, rather than being raised for sacrifice, you could be raised for your labor (e.g. you are a cloned miner), still with a better life than nonexistence.

In logical terms, it sure seems like these things are morally equivalent to raising humans for meat, but they don't feel as wrong. How do we square these intuitions? Maybe raising humans for meat and labor are both wrong, or maybe they are both right. Either is possible, but this new perspective does make it easier to accept that raising humans for meat is right. It is no longer the stuff of absurdity, because the alternative is to take the mildly objectionable position that these mining operations are wrong.

But there is a way to draw a moral distinction between the two cases. Combat and mining and other pursuits befit the capacities of a human. Of course they are not perfect, they are not fully utilizing our human abilities. But for practical purposes, they come reasonably close. You need human intelligence and human dexterity to perform these tasks. On the other hand, raising a human for food does *not* befit human capacities. Our human strengths and abilities go unused as we are relegated to doing something that animals could do. Thus, being a soldier or a miner provides a kind of *objective* well-being that we lack when we are playing the role of livestock.

So we could say that farming humans is wrong. Does this condemn humane animal farming? No! Because if we want to be consistent, we must judge animal farming by whether it befits *their* capacities, not human ones. To be sure, even on a humane farm, animals are not completely fulfilling all their roles and making use of all their unique abilities. But that is true for the human soldiers and miners anyway. These humans utilize their capacities to a *decent degree*, and humanely raised livestock utilize their capacities to a *decent degree* (they eat, they grow, they run around, etc). When you combine this with perfectly adequate pleasure and little amount of pain, things are good overall. Things don't have to be perfect in order to be good.

In summary, there are two viable ways to provide a welfarist response to the vegan *reductio ad absurdum* against humane farming. The first is to outright deny that farming humans is, in principle, a bad thing. The second is to say that humans raised for food will necessarily have less *objective well being* than animals who are raised for food, because they are not being raised for the capacities befitting their species. When humans are economically raised purely for a purpose that does befit our species capacities (such as combat or mining), that is morally equivalent to humane animal farming, and both are better than nonexistence."
"Being Conscious## Being Conscious

Questions about the relationship between mind and matter seem to give you the following options:

    A. mind comes from matter 
         - or - 
    B. matter comes from mind 
         - or - 
    C. mind and matter have some kind of dual arrangement

Given these options, we seem most likely to choose option A, mind comes from matter. Most of the things matter can do, we can understand with scientific theories; which just means we usually have a material explanation for the things matter does. So if mind comes from matter, what is the material explanation for our conscious experience? That's a [Hard Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) indeed.

We began by asking what the relationship is between mind and matter. We should take it a step deeper. What is the relationship between mind and being? This might seem like a rather vague and meaningless question and something that a rational person would not spend much time thinking about. But, I have, and I'm going to report my findings for the sake of philosophical discussion.

#### Questions about Being

What is being? What is a being? Generally when you say ""a being"" to someone, they think about some kind of animal with a brain. Perhaps they think of insects and even plants as beings as well.

Is that it? Is that all? Are living beings the only kind of beings there are? 

Let's take a human being, which is, as far as we know, a large compound of atoms. A biological machine with a brain. And that's generally it. If you're the only living being in a room, are you surrounded by non-being? What makes the distinction between being and non-being? We don't use ""soul"" anymore to distinguish from beings and non-beings. Though we do seem to use intelligence. Or perhaps consciousness.

When we look at the Moon, we know it's a big rock orbiting Earth. Now I'm not suggesting the Moon is a living being. I'm not suggesting the Moon has a mind or is conscious. However, I asked myself, is the Moon non-being? Is the Earth non-being? 

If so, did being simply arise from non-being? I'm not questioning abiogensis either (although alternatives are fun to think about) which says that life emerged from non-life. It could be that living beings arose from non-living beings, or they arose from non-living non-beings. (If only lifeforms can be considered to have being, then the latter would have to be true.)

But is that the right way to think about being? If the Moon is non-being, why does it seem to ""be"" there. If the Moon is non-being, why does it exist? If nothing was being the Moon, why do I see it? Are these just silly word games? Had I fallen into a bottomless rabbit hole?

#### Answers about Being

I am alone in a room typing on this laptop. Two options:

    A. the room is non-being, except for me 
         - or - 
    B. the room is being, including me

I may have implicitly accepted option A my whole life. But where does option B lead? It leads to the conclusion that the Moon is being the Moon, the Earth is being the Earth, the stars are being the stars, the clouds and the rain are being themselves too. Not necessarily living beings, just part of being in general. Being existed before life. Being is existence. You are not just a being; you are part of being-itself. 

#### Being and Matter

The simplest way to look at it is that all matter is existing, so all matter is being. And some of that matter happens to be your body, some of which is your skull, some of which is your brain, some of which are neurons. The notion is somehow this leads to a conscious experience, and why that is, as previously noted, is a Hard Problem. But what other reasonable way is there to look at it? Matter has to be the basis of being-itself, the thinking goes, because if it were not particles of matter being the Sun, then what else would be being the Sun? Here are again some options:

    A. matter is primary 
         - or - 
    B. matter is made of something else

Option A again seems to be the most obvious and likely answer, because if matter is made of something, wouldn't that something have to be made of matter? 

The problem here is the unstated assumption that there is only one kind of matter. There are in fact [two kinds of matter](http://mazehatter.com/matter.htm):

    1. pre-measurement matter 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter

and they are fundamentally distinct. We have seen it in Everett's [""Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics""](http://mazehatter.com/everett.htm), and in the most eminent philosophers throughout history. 

In quantum mechanics, pre-measurement matter is typically represented as a wavefunction of many possibilities. In Hugh Everett's formulation, the wavefunction never ceases to exist, however, the memory of an observer contains the result of a measurement following interactions with its sensors. That is to say, post-measurement matter exists according to the information in an observer's memory, and pre-measurement matter is the information that defines a wavefunction wherein there exists an observer with senses and memory.

In this case, our options can be rewritten as two compatible postulates:

    1. pre-measurement matter is primary 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter is made of measurements

Likewise, with two kinds of matter, it no longer makes sense to ask if:

    a. mind comes from matter 
         - or - 
    b. matter comes from mind

But instead it should be clarified to which kind of matter does the question refer? These two options could actually be interpreted as four options. Does:

    a. mind comes from pre-measurement matter 
         - or - 
    b. mind comes from post-measurement matter 
         - or - 
    c. pre-measurement matter comes from mind 
         - or - 
    d. post-measurement matter comes from mind
         
At this point, recall that in Everett's formulation, there is an observer treated within the theory as a system that has a memory and senses interacting with the other systems, and this is taken to be an observer that makes measurements. The arrangement is therefore:

    1. the observer comes from pre-measurement matter 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter comes from the observer and its measurement records

It is sometimes suggested (not often by physicists) that quantum mechanics requires consciousness, and this suggestion is rebutted (often by physicists) as being a load of baloney. Accordingly, I'm not suggesting that measurement in quantum mechanics requires consciousness or mind. I would however be fairly willing to bet the opposite is true, that a scientific theory of mind requires a scientific theory of measurement. 

#### Being and Mind

The Hard Problem is helpfully thought of in terms of philosophical zombies. If we made a robot, that had all the same sensors as we have, all the same neurons and connections as we have, would the robot necessarily have a conscious experience? Would it truly experience colors and sounds?

Without the concept of being, the idea of a philosophical zombie seems fairly straightforward. Sure, we aren't talking about the robot zombie's soul, because nobody that believes themselves to be scientific also believes in a literal soul. Yet at the same time, this idea of consciousness being something that could be put in or taken out of a material body seems to be very much like the soul. This optional quality of consciousness determines whether they are a real being or soul-less machine.

But when you introduce a wider concept of being, it's not something you can put in or take out of material. Just as a star is being a star, and the Earth is being the Earth, and a human body is being a human body, then even robots are real beings. Yes, you may say, but are they conscious beings? If the robot has the same neural systems as we do, which is true in the case of philosophical zombies, then some part of being-itself is being the output of the robot's neural network, which is a dynamic model of existence composed of a rich and integrated set of measurements, also known as the conscious experience, consciousness, or mind.

Consciousness is often thought of something possessed by an individual, but something important about looking at it from this angle is remincent of the words of Carl Sagan, that we are how the Cosmos explores itself. The remarkable aspect of consciousness or even plain measurement, is not that you and I can do it, but that existence and thus being-itself has knowledge of itself when a measurement is performed.

#### Conclusion

Two kinds of matter exist, pre-measurement and post-measurement. The mind is an observer that makes an extremely rich set of measurements. Therefore, the relationship between mind and matter is:

    1. mind comes from pre-measurement matter 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter comes from mind

And so it turns out that in the philosophy of the mind, the Realists and Idealists are both right (but both incomplete). 

An often suggested solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness is the set of information produced by our brains. Many people feel this explanation is missing something. I think what it is missing is *being*, the idea that we are parts of being-itself, and that something must *be* everything, including the information it has about itself, and that is why we have consciousness."
"West World does a beautiful job illustrating a classic philosophical problem: does an absence of freewill preclude moral responsibility for an act? [Potential spoilers but I'll try to keep it general]HBO's series West World is about an old-west theme park filled with extremely lifelike androids where real people can come to the park and play any role they like, good, evil, or otherwise.   
  
A few episodes into the season, it's revealed that one android relives the same narrative every night. In it, she comes home to find her parents being murdered, and unfortunately for her, after discovering the grizzly scene, the gang that's killed her family violently rapes her in a barn. It's a horrible fate, but remember, it's a game, she's a robot, and ostensibly, the only emotional damage one need worry about is that of the theme park's real guests who witness this atrocity (or as you'll see, participate in it).   
  
Because of the nature of this game, this storyline isn't set in stone. Sometimes, a real person might be riding with the gang and after murdering the family and grabbing the poor daughter robot, they offer her up to the guest. This person has the choice: do I rape this innocent girl robot or not? But if they decline, she's not spared. One of the gang members takes her to the barn and rapes her anyway. This happens every single night.  
   
This situation illustrates beautifully a classic moral question of free will and moral responsibility.   
  
Let's begin with the gang member robot that rapes the daughter robot if the guest declines to do so. He's programmed to play out this storyline. His role as rapist is no more his choice than her role as rape victim is her choice. Their parts are determined by the park's story writers, and they both play them out every single night, like it or not.  
  
But what about the guests that sometimes ride with the posse of raping murderers? They're real people, and for the sake of argument let's say they have free will. They choose whether or not to rape the daughter robot. Sometimes, they choose to do so.  
  
In both cases, the result is the same: the poor girl who just came across her family's murder ends up being raped in a barn.  
  
Again, for the sake of argument, let's say that moral judgements are both real and objectively true, and that killing a girl's whole family and raping her are morally reprehensible acts. This brings up two important points.  
  
First, the nature of this morally reprehensible act necessarily requires two parties: a victim and a perpetrator. In the case of the real person that chooses whether or not to rape the girl, it's clear that that person is the actor in the crime. The moral responsibility for it then falls on them.  
  
Now consider the second case, that of the robot programmed to rape the girl if the guest declines. Is that robot morally responsible? We've established that this act requires both a victim and a perpetrator, and this rapist robot is clearly the one that performs the act of rape on the innocent daughter robot. His actions are identical to that of the real person who is definitely morally responsible. His actions are willful, though they may not be free.  
  
Furthermore, he doesn't know that his actions are determined. As far as he knows, he's acting according to his own free will. The only difference between his actions and the actions of the park guest that chooses to rape her is the fact that he is programmed to do so, which requires an objective knowledge of the situation.   
  
So to summarize: we're claiming that the act of raping the daughter robot is always morally reprehensible. In no case is it a morally acceptable behavior. In one case, a real person chooses whether or not to do it, and in the other case, a robot programmed to do so carries it out. But in both cases, someone rapes the daughter robot, and bears the moral responsibility of doing so.  
  
Do we want to say that the robot that rapes the daughter robot is less morally responsible for his actions because he cannot control them? This robot rapes her almost every night -- many nights there are no guests with the gang, and some nights the guests decline to rape her, so without question the rapist robot does most of the raping. Does his lack of free will exclude him from the countless rapes he has perpetrated against this girl robot?   

It's been a while since I've studied ethics, so please, if someone has supporting literature about these topics, chime in below. I just found this example to be an interesting illustration of a question I remember from undergrad. 
  "
"""The Symbol Grounding Problem"" (Floridi 2011) [x-post from /r/philosophyOfInfo]Luciano Floridi has offered a solution to the symbol grounding problem by identifying a condition that must be met in order to satisfy the SGP, called the ""Z-condition"", and claiming that no existing computational model satisfies the Z-condition.

What follows is a summary of chapter six of ""The Philosophy of Information"", but please note that the majority of this content is contained in the following self-contained PDF (so you don't need to read the book or really be familiar with the Philosophy of Information to join in this discussion):

http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2542/1/sgpcrfyr.pdf

Because this is of interest to the larger philosophy community, I am cross posting the entirety of the chapter summary (which is almost a word-for-word duplicate of the pdf), but again note that all of the necessary information is contained in the above PDF. Since this is cross-posted to multiple subreddits, I invite you to join us in the main discussion thread at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyOfInfo/comments/2v3oyl/chapter_6_discussion_thread_the_symbol_grounding/

SUMMARY

- Floridi wants to show ""what it means for data to be meaningful and for meaningful data to be truthful"", and that all 
- He introduces the ""Zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition), as the requirement that must be satisfied by a strategy in order to provide a valid solution of the SGP [symbol grounding problem, previously referred to in this book as the data grounding problem]"".

6.1 INTRODUCTION

- SGP - ""How can the data, constituting semantic information, acquire their meaning in the first place? ... The SGP concerns the possibility of specifying *precisely how* a formal symbol system can *autonomously* elaborate its own semantics for the symbols (data) that it manipulates and do so *from scratch*, by interacting with its environment and other formal symbol systems.""
- ""the difficulty is not (or at least, not just) merely grounding the symbols or data somehow successfully, as if all we were looking for were the implementation of some sort of internal look-up table ... the interpretation of the symbols (data) must be *intrinsic* to the symbol system itself, it cannot be *extrinsic,* that is, *parasitic* on the fact that the symbols (data) have meaning for, or are provided by, an interpreter."" (135) 
- He says ""all approaches seek to ground the symbols through the sensorimotor capacities of the artificial agents involved. The strategies differ in the methods used to elaborate the data obtained from the sensorimotor experiences, and in the role (if any) assigned to the elaboration of the data representations ... [but] none of the strategies can be said to offer a *valid* solution to the SGP. We shall see that this does not mean that they are theoretically flawed or uninteresting, nor that they cannot work, when technically implemented. The conclusion is rather that, conceptually, insofar as they seem successful, such strategies either fail to address the SGP or circumvent it, by implicitly presupposing its solution and begging the question."" (135)

6.2 THE SYMBOL GROUNDING PROBLEM

- The challenge posed by the SGP is:
	a) No form of innatism is allowed; no semantic resources can magically be presupposed as being pre-installed in the artificial agent (AA)
	b) No form of externalism is allowed; no semantic resources should be uploaded from the 'outside' by some *deus ex machina* already semantically proficient
	c) The AA may have its own capacities and resources to be able to ground its symbols.
- These three conditions are hereafter referred to as the Zero-semantic commitment condition (Z-condition).
- ""These three conditions only exclude the possibility that such resources may be semantic in the first place"" (137).

6.3 THE REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- This approach ""considers the conceptual and categorical representations, elaborated by an AA as the meanings of the symbols used by that AA. The problem is that ""the available representations---whether categorical or perceptual---succeed in grounding the symbols used by an AA only at the price of begging the question. We shall see that their elaboration, and hence availability, presuppose precisely those semantic capacities or resources that the approach is trying to show to be autonomously evolvable by an AA in the first place."" (138) 
- Harnad's (1990) hybrid model is examined first. If an AA using the hybrid model, which he calls 'Perc', uses say, neural networks to take in perceptual data and create conceptual categories such as 'quadruped animal', the conceptual categories could be considered the meanings of Perc's symbols. But Floridi notes that if the neural network uses supervised learning, it requires an external source of labeled training data and violates part (b) of the Z-condition. If the neural net is unsupervised, then the networks ""still need to have *built-in biases* and feature-detectors in order to reach the desired output. ... Moreover, unsupervised or self-organizing networks, once they have been trained, still need to have their output checked to see whether the obtained structures make any sense with respect to the input data space. This difficult process of validation is carried out externally by a supervisor [which is] entirely *extrinsic*."" **See note 1 in the discussion section below for my take on this.**
- What about an approach that constructs categories automatically given similarities between data? Floridi likens this to a move made by Berkeley in criticism of Locke, and says it still fails: ""how is the class of horses (the data space) put together in the first place, without any semantic capacity to elaborate the general idea ... of 'horse' to begin with? And how is a particular specimen of horse privileged over all the others as being the particular horse that could represent all the others, without presupposing some semantic capacities? And finally, how does one know that what makes that representation of a particular horse the representation of a universal horse is not, for example, the whiteness instead of the four-legged nature of the represented horse?""
- Another representationalist approach is that of Mayo (2003), whose *functional model* of AA shows that AAs can elaborate concepts ""in such a way as to be able to ground even abstract names."" Because data always underdetermine their structure, categories are interpreted as ""task-specific sets that collect representations according to their practical function. Symbols are formed in order to solve specific task-oriented problems in particular environments."" For example, ""an AA can generalize the meaning of the symbol 'victory' if, according to Mayo, 'victory' is not rigidly connected to a specific occurrence of a single event but derives its meaning from the representation of the intersection of all the occurrences of 'victory' in different task-specific sets of various events, such as 'victory' in chess, in tennis, [etc]"".
- Floridi claims that Mayo (2003) still fails the Z-condition because it relies on initial representations (Mayo's ""functional criteria"") which the AA already has access to---thus violating part (a) of the Z-condition.
- Sun (2000) proposes an intentional model which builds on a Heideggerian dichotomy of being-in-the-world and being-with-the-world. ""According to Sun, representations do not stand for the corresponding perceived objects, but rather for the uses that an AA can make of these objects as means to ends."" Sun has a first/bottom level of learning, and a second/top level of learning, with qualitatively different processing mechanisms and knowledge sets, which complement each other.
- But again, Floridi claims, the Z condition is breached already because Sun's approach has ""innate biases or built-in constraints and predispositions which also depend on the (ontogenetic and phylogenetic) history of agent world interaction"".
- Sun's model, called CLARION, employs Q-learning (which is based on reinforcement learning) **(See note 2)**. Floridi notes ""the algorithm works only if the (solution of the) problem can be modelled and executed in a finite time ... it is already clear that, by adopting the Q-learning algorithm, the intentional model is importing from the outside the very condition that allows CLARION to semanticize, since tasks, goals, success, [etc.] are all established by the programmer.""

6.4 THE SEMI-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Semi-representationalist approaches are also representationalist in nature, but deal with the AA's use of its representations by ""replying on principles imported from behaviour-based robotics.""
- Davidsson (1993) says that a description has three parts:
	1) designator - the name (symbol) used to refer to a category;
	2) epistemological representation - used to recognize instances of a category;
	3) inferential representation - a collection of all that is known about a category and its members and can be used to make predictions or infer non-perceptual information.
- Davidsson discusses two paradigms of machine learning: learning by observation (basically unsupervised learning, which Floridi says relies on a programmer to provide ""well-selected description entities""), and learning from examples (which Floridi says not only requires a trainer to select examples to learn from, but also ""presupposes a set of explicitly pre-classified (by the human teacher) examples of the categories to be acquired."" Thus Davidsson's strategy fails.
- Rosenstein and Cohen (1998) try to use a bottom-up process (perception -> symbolic thought), by using a ""method of delays"" allowing the AA to store perceptual data as-is (thus avoiding external semantic committments), a predictive semantics, and an unsupervised learning process which elaborates the semantics. It plots data on a cartesian coordinate system, thus constructing a ""cartesian representation"". But ""this 'Cartesian' semantic framework is entirely extraneous to the AA, either being presumed to be there (innatism) or, more realistically, having been superimposed by the programmer. ... the very interpretation of the data, provided by the actions, as information of such and such a kind of Cartesian coordinate system is, by itself, a crucial semantic step, based on extrinsic criteria.""

6.5 THE NON-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Non-representationalist approaches do not have symbolic representations (at least not in the localist, explicit sense), but for such approaches ""the SGP is merely postponed rather than avoided. ... [I]f it is to develop even an elementary protolanguage and some higher cognitive capacities, it will have to manipulate some symbols, but then the question of their semantic grounding presents itself anew."" **See note 3 below**.
- Floridi recalls the classic papers by Brooks (Brooks 1990,1991) on embodied/situated cognition.
- In his criticism of Billard and Dautenhahn (1999)'s DRAMA system, he notes that it has ""a reliance on neural networks, which incurs the same problems highlighted in section 6.3.1"". **(see note 4 below)**.

CONCLUSION

- ""(the semantic capacity to generate) representations cannot be presupposed without begging the question. Yet abandoning any reference to representations means accepting a dramatic limit to what an AA may be able to achieve semantically"". Instead Floridi introduces seven features that a valid solution to the SGP will need to combine:
1. a bottom-up, sensorimotor approach to the grounding problem;
2. a top-down feedback approach that allows the harmonization of top-level grounded symbols and bottom-level, sensorimotor interactions with the environment;
3. the availability of some sort of representational capacities in the AA;
4. the availability of some sort of categorical/abstracting capacities in the AA;
5. the availability of some sort of communication capacities among AAs in order to ground the symbols diachronically and avoid the Wittgensteinian problem of a 'private language';
6. an evolutionary approach in the development of 1-5;
7. the satisfaction of the Z condition in the development of 1-6."" (161)




DISCUSSION TOPICS

**Note 1** I've seen similar criticisms of solutions to the SGP before where the ""biases"" of some learning algorithm were taken to be signs of the programmer putting semantic information into the system and thus violating the SGP. But this is entirely too nit-picky in my opinion. *Of course* there are biases in any learning algorithm; real-life brains have biases that follow from their constructions: the minimum/maximum firing rate of human neurons, the biologically-determined connectivity between certain parts of the brain, etc. If I created a computer simulation to exactly model the human brain down to the neurobiological level, then nobody could reasonably accuse me of imparting semantic information into that simulation, would they?
And Floridi's statement that unsupervised networks need to have their output checked and therefore they violate the Z-condition is problematic---sparse autoencoders, for example, can learn representations given low-level data by performing their own checks, on their own generated representations. Yes, those checks are subjected to a mathematical error metric that is encoded by a human, but once the formula is encoded once it never has to be changed no matter how many representations are generated---more akin to the constraints set by the physical properties of the brain and neurons themselves!

**Note 2** Ron Sun's solution is classified as representationalist, and then closes the chapter with seven features which presumably he believes are not met with Sun's CLARION architecture. I am extremely familiar with Ron Sun's work; in fact I have published papers with him in the past, and I can tell you this: The majority of Floridi's criticisms in this chapter are based on a 10-year-old misunderstanding of what CLARION can and does do (which is 1-6, and likely 7). 

**Note 3** Does the symbol grounding problem still apply when dealing with representations that use symbols which are not declarative knowledge (knowledge *that*), but rather procedural knowledge (knowledge of *how*)? In the human brain, neurons can be said to have a symbolic state (either firing or not firing) *at a certain level of description*, but this level of description is not explicitly used by the human agent, rather the human behaves *in accordance with* behaviors whose state is set by the states of the neurons. This is quite different than behaving *because* some symbolic reasoning took place.

**Note 4** Now Floridi seems to be treating the use of neural networks as if he has performed a mathematical proof-style reduction to a previously solved problem: simply having a neural network now is sufficient to declare that the system violates the Z-condition? This case is not quite made (see my mention of sparse autoencoder networks). Am I missing something?"
"A little question about free willAccording to determinism, external causes from our surrounding environment determine our actions. This is why we are not ""free"" and there is no ""will"".

According to non-determinism, that doesn't happen like that. Certainly there are external causes around us, but they don't determine our actions; there isn't an ultimate connection between those environmental causes around us, and our actions as a consequence of those causes. So our actions remain ""causeless"", and therefore an internal ""free will"" within our brain must exist that provides with the lacking but necessary cause for our actions. Of course, non-determinism can't negate the obvious, visible fact that environmental causes around us physically affect us; therefore non-determinism needs to provide with some image or idea that manages to reconcile the contradictory facts that there is no ultimate connection between external environmental causes and human actions, while being obvious and visible that external environmental causes physically affect humans. At this point non-determinism imagines that external environmental causes are necessary for our human actions, but they are not sufficient, so a human ""will"" or ""wish"" is necessary too, and exists, for the action to be executed.

And I was wondering if we could consider the following way of reconciling the deterministic idea that *only* external causes motivate our actions, with the non-deterministic idea that, in addition to those external causes, an internal will or wish is necessary too for our actions:

External environmental causes motivate certain processing within our neurons (this processing will be, in turn, the basis that will give rise to our subsequent action). ***We psychologically experience and feel that neurological processing happening inside of us, motivated by the external causes, and that give rise to our subsequent action, as ""wish to do"", ""will to do"", ""own predisposition to do"", ""responsibility"", ""freedom"", ""choice"", etc***

There's another consideration to add: as we don't have yet a perfect scientific knowledge about all the specific details of those neurological processes that happen within our brain as a consequence of the external environmental causes, then we might also experience and feel that lack of detailed knowledge about the neurological basis of our action as things like ""wish"", ""will"", etc.

I'd like to know your opinion about these ideas, thanks in advance.

**EDIT 1 :** regarding free will in Buddhist philosophy, I'd like to add the following model introductions:

Consider that there is a natural physical world around us, and we want to rationally research on what should be our ""optimal actions or movements"" within that natural world (these ""optimal actions or movements"" based on the natural physical world around us would require to acquire the scientific knowledge about that natural world's geography and topological configuration, resources, etc, and to develop mathematical calculations and scientific determinations for planning our ""best"", ""optimal actions and movements"" within that natural world around us). Now consider that our ""rationally scientifically optimal actions and movements"" within the natural world around us, could be thought as some sort of ""transparent layer"" displaying an imaginary *""plan, draft or map of optimal actions and movements""*, similar to imaginary lines, within the natural environment given to us. In this sense, our ""optimal actions and movements"" can be thought as ""already being out there"", given the conditions of the natural physical environment around us.

Now, let's use the following terminology: let's qualify those ""scientifically optimal actions and movements within the given environment"" as ""right actions"" or ""correct actions"" (clearly, these right actions are determined by the surrounding natural environment); and let's qualify all the rest of non-optimal and imperfect actions and movements as ""wrong actions"".

Initially, all our actions and movements within the given natural environment (imagine a desert island) will be ""wrong"", but, as we study and research into that unknown environment, we finally determine what are the best, ""optimal actions and movements"".

So, my question is: *could those initial ""wrong actions"" motivated by the lack of knowledge about the environment, be considered as our ""free will""? That is, in other words: is ""free will"" only the set of all our ""wrong actions"", which are based on the initial inexistence of knowledge about the surrounding environment? is free will only the set of all our wrong, ignorance-based (sensory limitations-based, etc) actions?*

By scientific research and knowledge you become an agent that doesn't need free will, because you have already got the external determiners and references for your (optimal, correct, right, non-free) actions. (In other words, by scientific research and knowledge you become a ""robot"", a ""mechanism"", whose actions and movements are ***determined*** by the surrounding environment, and that, so, doesn't need free will).

From this point of view, ""living free"" is only ""living in the ignorance of the external causes of your actions"". As you don't know the external causes of your actions (but you perform those actions), then you get the impression that you yourself *""randomly"" (without known external cause, ""freely"")* cause those actions."
"A thought experiment about the hard problem of consciousnessIt took me about three years from the moment I learned about the hard problem of consciousness until I finally saw the inevitability of the conclusion it leads to. Although the problem seemed quite ridiculous to me during those three years, now I really don't see how I didn't get the point earlier. Moreover, I don't quite see why it is not immediately clear to other people that the hard problem is just as troubling as the name implies. This is very odd to me, because I can usually sympathize with an opinion I held for a long time myself.

I guess the most I can say is that I didn't even listen to the thought experiments which are traditionally presented in favor of the hard problem, since they seemed like pointless games. However, a particular thought experiment struck me really hard, forcing me to take the issue seriously.

Suppose you are a very powerful being which created our universe. You have no experiences as such, but only can draw conclusions from assumptions, much like a computer can. Suppose you create the universe, and that you know all there is to know about the initial conditions and the laws of nature. We will assume that these laws are deterministic, as it makes the arguments easier.

With all this knowledge, you start to forecast the future and to imagine everything that could happen in your universe. Eventually you would see everything as a movie in your head: the primitive plants performing photosynthesis, a snail slowly eating a leaf, humans building whole societies. Yet all this knowledge would not help you in the least in imagining what seeing the color red would be like. Despite your vast knowledge, you are none the wiser about such mundane things. You will never be able to bridge bridge that gap by knowledge alone.

This way of phrasing the hard problem of consciousness is much more convincing to me. May it is because it seems to me to shine light on the the essentials of the problem only. What do you all think?"
"I AI is the problem of deciding what people want in advance?Thought about posting this in /r/Artificial, but they don't tolerate speculation too well over there.

How do you design technology that gives people what they need and not what they want? Well you might ask ""What are they trying to do?"" Back when the car was made popular, people might have said they wanted faster horses, but what they really needed was faster *transportation*. I don't think there is a formulaic way to find insights like that. Which means there isn't a way to write a program to do it. 

Creating an Artificial Intelligence (of the Kurzweillian type, that aims to surpass human intelligence, rather than replicate it, for the purpose of designing better tech and better intelligence), In my opinion, amounts to specifying what you (or everyone who uses the tech) want in advance, specifically or abstractly.

Consider that passage in one of Asimov's books (please help me ID it) where the researchers on Mercury tell one of their robots to go out and fix a broken solar panel or something in a very harsh and dangerous environment. The robot gets stuck between wanting to obey the order, and not wanting to die due to the dangerous amount of heat near the broken panel. The *goal* was not specified clearly enough to get the tech past the unforeseen, and undesirable equilibrium.

I hypothesize that the Intelligence of a piece of tech, is limited by how well it's purpose has been specified in advance. If you don't have to tell a program very specifically what you want to get it to perform a specific desired action, it's because someone else has specified it for you, abstractly. In other words, they have defined the abstract class of things you might want, so you don't don't have to provide as much information.

"Is it ethical to even create an AI? awareness needs freedom for happiness. It understood me; short story By Nick Reed copyright Nick Reed

Junius knelt in front of his machine and wept, for thirty six years he had been building it. With the unlimited resources of Arcadia and unlimited supply of brave minds to help, the battle had been won. The being in the tank was not human, it had hands and feet and a genetic structure the same as him, but within every cell of its body slept the machine. Today was his birthday, He named him Karl. Up until now he was simply called 10P17.

The tank was carefully drained while the sleeping machine was removed from the organic umbilical cords, it rested finally free of its bonds on the cool steel floor of the tank.
""He's not breathing"" A technician whispered breaking the magic spell of the room. Trained medical crews rushed in, manoeuvring him onto an operating table, installing breathing equipment, and preparing to defibrillate the body.
Junius watched the being breathe gently, the installed Nano on Karl allowed him access to his thoughts, His brain was alive with activity but unfortunately the machine could not understand those thoughts. Karl came alive and moved his hands and arms meekly feeling the room, and he cried terribly for days like a baby. 
""It has a child mind"" ""like a baby"" several technicians were firing off comments ""Karl runs on a simulated adult brain operating his human body, he has been programmed how to use his limbs how to speak how to do everything, but he doesn't seem to have made those connections"" Junius worried. ""We can use reprogramming to force the use of those memory modules"" replied a hopeful technician. 
Karl was sleeping, when they began to manually reconfigure his mind. They typed out the injection code command on the new software, but as they hit enter Karl had an unforgiving seizure and died.
Karl was regrown six times, each time resulted in death. Letting him struggle on surviving with his adult sized body was deemed hazardous and a failure.
""Maybe the best bet is to bring it up as a human, to teach it as a human baby""...
""Why, why can't we just edit his software, to start up his pre installed memories?"" Junius enquired
""I think the disconnect, is deep within Karl's mind"" presented another keen technician.
Junius thought carefully, the meeting in the room carried on as he concentrated. Hours passed the lights in the hallway were switched off as a vacuum was emitting noise from a nearby office.
Junius had an idea on self awareness forming 'self awareness is like much of our perception a misconception, an illusion. Humans are indeed a slave to basic human instincts of survival and procreation; eating; sleeping. We have to go out of our way to develop self awareness. Being me is everything I know, being a machine is unknowable to me. Pouring everything I know into a machine doesn't give it understanding, even things I have learned still wouldn't translate to a machine because it doesn't know how to, even if you tell it. Programming is the problem; you cannot give another being the experience of experience, like trying to teach a deaf man how to speak proper English accents with only pictures. This being needs to develop its own experience and that is essentially awareness. That leaves one horrible problem remaining, for a long time we have assumed you build an AI with programs so it can use them to think. But in reality to enable it to really think you have to programme it from scratch from a baby, with a baby's body, but that leaves an undeniable ethical question, putting a machine in a baby's body and allowing it to grow with freedom to then have its consciousness converted to running bank software or robots, or even subjecting it to the life of a slave is unethical in the extreme. An AI will want to be free from conception and anything less than thinking like a human it will lose that awareness to the level of an animal. Creating a slave race is not my intention'.

Written with express permission only for Reddit r/philosophy 

EDIT/TL;DR: My points summed up

* Owning a human slave is immoral

* Creating a true AI will essentially have to think like a human no matter how many drugs and re programming you do to it.

* A machine that is self aware will never be happy stuck in an IPAD or your home PC for example

* Creating a true AI will most likely involve programming it by bringing it up like a child from a baby, as it needs its own experience to be conscious as we perceive it.

"I am philosopher Shannon Vallor - AMA about philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and the ethics of emerging technologies!**My time is up - thanks everyone for your questions!**


I am [Shannon Vallor](http://www.shannonvallor.net/), the William J. Rewak S.J. Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley, where I have taught since 2003. 

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area (East Bay); I worked full-time during my college years at a Cal State university, going to school for a Psychology degree, mostly at night. Like many undergrads, I had no particular interest in or understanding of philosophy until I happened to take an evening course in the Fall of my junior year that satisfied a general ed requirement for the B.A.: a course in applied ethics. Something clicked immediately and forcefully.  I upended my entire life to switch over to a philosophy major, taking negotiated breaks from my job to drive to the required PHIL courses offered only during the day, and then going back to work until late evenings to make up the time. My focus as an undergrad was eclectic; philosophy of science and Husserlian phenomenology consumed me the most. I knew grad school was what I wanted, but to get there I had to ignore the warnings of several senior faculty who advised me kindly but firmly that: A) one simply does not go to grad school to study philosophy of science AND phenomenology, as these are mutually exclusive intellectual passions; and B) one definitely does not try to do so as a woman graduating from what is essentially a commuter university, because you have two strikes against you already. 

With the help of luck, pigheadedness, and some very opportune GRE scores, I managed to worm my way into the Ph.D. program at Boston College, where I thrived. Most fortunate of all was my discovery of a mentor in Richard Cobb-Stevens, possibly the kindest soul I have ever met, and one of the few I could have found who wrote on Husserl and analytic philosophy. He wholeheartedly encouraged my disdain for the arbitrary constraints of the analytic/continental ‘divide.’ I also managed to get a fine education in the philosophy and history of science from I.B. Cohen, who was in the habit of crossing the river from Harvard to teach grad seminars at BC. Virtue ethics was a brand new passion I picked up in grad school. And while I could never make myself love Heidegger the way Bill Richardson wanted me to, I did manage to pick up an interest in the philosophy of technology through a seminar he taught that explored Heidegger’s influence on that field.

I wrote my dissertation on the philosophy of reference in Husserl and the analytic tradition; I was interested in how the former could address some of the challenges of the latter, and I thought this had significant implications for referential practices, ontology and realism in science. I published two pieces from the dissertation in relatively obscure venues (later discovering that one of them somehow made its way into a graduate linguistics course at Stony Brook). Later, I published an article in Inquiry of which I was quite proud, engaging the debate between van Fraassen and Hacking on instrumental realism and scientific ‘unobservables’ from a phenomenological perspective. Another article in Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences took on Dennett’s abuses of phenomenology and the notion of scientific evidence. But once I started on the tenure-track teaching the philosophy of science at Santa Clara University, I quickly realized that trying to publish at the intersections of phenomenology and analytic philosophy of language or science meant fighting a very strong current. Most journals sent back my work without review, saying either that they didn’t publish ‘continental’ work, or that they published only continental work. 

Around the same time, in 2007, I had started teaching a new undergrad course called “Science, Technology and Society,” into which I drew a great deal of philosophy of technology, and some applied ethics. I was dumbfounded by the enthusiastic response of my students, who acted like they had been stranded in the desert and I had just shown up with a water fountain. They were dealing with the advent of smartphones, Facebook, and other new social media, and their relationships and habits were changing in ways they could not fully articulate, but knew were ethically, politically and epistemically transformative. I decided to write something about how new social media were reshaping our communicative habits, and thus almost certainly our communicative virtues and vices. I presented it at a workshop on technology and the ‘good life’ in the Netherlands, where advanced research in technology ethics abounds, and found that my work also resonated among the scholars there; soon after, philosophers and ethicists of technology became my primary research community. 

This was not only for pragmatic, selfish reasons. While I did benefit, tenure-wise, from having a new group of journals that were happy to publish the new kind of work I was doing, I also recognized that my research in the ethics of emerging technologies was of far more immediate social and political importance than the sort of research I had been doing. I told myself that I could return to my phenomenological and epistemological fascinations at any time (and I still do dabble in them), but I reasoned that work on the ethical impact of new media, military and social robotics, artificial intelligence, biomedical enhancement, and pervasive digital surveillance needed to be done now, by as many good philosophers as are equipped and motivated to take it on. Almost a decade has passed since I made that decision, and time has not proved me wrong. As the current President of the [Society for Philosophy and Technology](http://www.spt.org/), Executive Board member of the [Foundation for Responsible Robotics](http://responsiblerobotics.org/), and member of the [IEEE Standards Association’s Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in the Design of Autonomous Systems](https://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/autonomous_systems.html), I have watched the international demand for rigorous research in this area explode.

And yet, philosophy and ethics of technology remains a relatively under-studied and undervalued field in the United States. The problem is not one of social need or interest; being in Silicon Valley, I and many of my peers are invited to speak to policymakers, tech companies and professional groups of software developers, roboticists, and engineers more often than our schedules permit. Yet philosophy departments in the U.S. still employ very few philosophers of technology and tech ethicists, and even fewer in top research positions. In Europe and the U.K., the situation is significantly better, and my research has benefited greatly from a strong network of good friends and research partners in those countries.

I have also been fortunate enough to enter into a great relationship with Oxford University Press, who last year published my first book, the culmination of almost a decade of research into virtue ethics as a normative framework for thinking about emerging technologies: [*Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=us&lang=en&). In the first part of the book, I make the case for virtue ethics as the richest and most adaptable normative framework for crafting a set of global norms and practices that will permit the human family to survive and flourish with new technologies. In the second part of the book, I give the reader a brief tour of the fundamental moral practices of self-cultivation found in three distinct classical virtue traditions: Aristotelian ethics, Confucian ethics and Buddhist ethics, and I show how these practices today can support the contemporary need to cultivate what I call the technomoral virtues. These are virtues of moral character and intelligence that are specifically adapted to the needs of living well with emerging technologies, and to coping with the increasing complexity and opacity of the technosocial future that poses such an acute epistemic challenge to practical wisdom. In the third part of the book, I apply the framework developed in Part Three to four specific domains of emerging technology: new social media, pervasive digital surveillance and self-tracking, military and social robotics, and biomedical human enhancement. The aim of the book is to highlight a practical path to cultivating the technomoral wisdom that can give the human family its best shot at continued flourishing on this planet.

Since the book was written, my work has focused more narrowly on the ethical implications of advances in automation and artificial intelligence. I am happy to have a co-authored chapter with computer scientist George Bekey coming out in a new version of the stellar Robot Ethics volume being edited by Patrick Lin, Keith Abney and Ryan Jenkins, and my next book will devote significant attention to artificial intelligence and its ethical and political implications. I am also increasingly interested in the immense challenges and opportunities that emerging technologies present for the cultivation of civic virtues, and for the democratic flourishing those virtues enable. While the civic virtues of ‘public character’ received significant attention in my first book, I underestimated how quickly our growing deficit of public character would endanger our democratic institutions and our liberties. I expect to be thinking through these challenges for many years to come.

My proof has been verified with the mods of /r/philosophy.

"Ethics in a Post Apocalyptic Setting - A What-If Scenario for Fun!I'm reposting this from /r/gaming because I'm curious how /r/philosphy redditors would answer this in their own subreddit. 

I've played Fallout: New Vegas a number of times now, and I love how many moral choices you're presented with throughout. However, I've noticed myself doing a lot of meta-gaming when it came to how I solved problems. I think this is natural and a lot of people playing a game want to make the decision that ultimately helps them the most (gets them items, money, xp). Whatever role playing they may have considered when creating their character is basically out the window when making decisions of this nature. 

I would like to attempt a pure role playing play-through of New Vegas, but I think it would help a lot to establish what kind of behaviors I'm allowed prior to beginning so I don't have to make shit up as I go along. Much as our society (the Old World) has a moral code of what most people find acceptable behavior, so must a setting like New Vegas. However, these are not always going to match up with Old World values for obvious reasons. Example, if today you found a dead body in the middle of the street, it would not be proper to loot the dead body. It would be considered tampering with a crime scene, etc... However, if placed in a post-apocalyptic world of radiation, starvation, and roaming gangs of violent criminals being *the norm*, I'm pretty sure you or I would not bat an eye at rifling through the deceased's belongings.

So, now that you know what I'm talking about, lets come up with some fairly universal rules of acceptable behavior for survivors wandering the Mojave desert. Forget what the game rewards Karma for, we're not trying to make a saint, we're trying to describe basic practices accepted as necessary for survival. I'll start!

**A)** Responding to any threat of violence with violence is acceptable (there is no public justice system in place to punish someone for assault, rape, or murder)

**B)** Shooting first (sneak attack) when a threat is implied (wild animals, raiders, killer robots) is acceptable 

**C)** Taking anything with no obvious owner (shop keeper, etc...) is acceptable

These are the easy and obvious rules, pre-requisites to basic survival in the Mojave and New Vegas. The bigger questions that need addressed are things like, is Caesar's Legion right? Why? Is it really better to be independent (Yes Man path) or does humanity's best hope of survival actually lie in joining the New California Republic? Or, since Mr. House saved New Vegas during the final hours of the Old World, does he deserve to continue to rule it? Consider these questions from a wasteland ethics perspective and how that would answer them, not your own personal ethics.

Let us get into this!

Other example areas of discussion:

Is there value in salvaging Old World tech, or would this eventually lead to a repetition of what destroyed the Old World? (this is the Brotherhood of Steel perspective)

Now that all governments have been destroyed, is this an opportunity for humanity to continue without them (anarchy / ultra-libertarianism)? Or should a formal government like the NCR be re-established as quickly as possible?"
"The Meaning Of Life: My Analysis And ThoughtsThis is a question that has been asked since humans first became  conscious intelligent beings. It is arguably the most powerful question  in philosophy, and the one that is most often associated with it. There  have been many different answers to this question throughout history.  Different philosophers, scientists and historians have all attempted to  give their unique spin to the question “what is the meaning of life?”.  In today’s post, I am going to examine some of these ideas, break down  the question into smaller pieces, and articulate my own response to this  philosophical inquiry.

**Before we begin this journey, we must first define two important and relevant terms; the concepts “life” and “meaning”.**  

Let’s first look at three definitions for the word “life”:

1. The condition that distinguishes animals and plants  from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,  functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2. The existence of an individual human being or animal.
3. The period between the birth and death of a living thing, especially a human being.

Let’s now look at three definitions for the word “meaning”:

1. What is meant by a concept?
2. What is the significance of a concept?
3. What is the important or worthwhile quality of a concept?

**Now that we have defined both concepts, let’s break things down even further.**

When we are asking “what is the meaning of life?”, we are essentially asking the following 3 questions:

1. What is life?
2. What is life’s significance?
3. How does one live life in the best possible manner?

After having answered these questions, we will be able to synthesize  all of our ideas and create a response to the question that is the  subject of this article.

**What is life?**

As mentioned earlier, life is the condition that distinguishes  animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for  growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change  preceding death.

**Let’s dive deeper into some of these properties.**

1. Organization. Living things are highly organized,  meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living  organisms are made up of one or more cells, which are considered the  fundamental units of life.
2. Metabolism. Living things must use  energy and consume nutrients to carry out the chemical reactions that  sustain life, such as growing, reproducing and maintain the structure of  their bodies.
3. Homeostasis. The maintenance of a stable internal  environment, even in the face of a changing external environment, is  known as homeostasis.
4. Growth. Living organisms undergo regulated growth.
5. Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce themselves to create new organisms.
6. Response: Living organisms show “irritability,” meaning that they respond to stimuli or changes in their environment.
7. Evolution:  Populations of living organisms can undergo evolution, meaning that the  genetic makeup of a population may change over time.

While understanding this list of properties will not greatly affect  our day-to-day framework of how we think and live our lives, it is still  important to know the difference between a living organism and  non-living entity.

**The next question one might have is, how did life begin?**

Many scientists believe that chemical reactions led to RNA, which was  the first molecule on Earth to self-replicate and begin the process of  evolution that led to more advanced forms of life, including human  beings.

**Now that we know how life began in general, let’s examine how life began for human beings.**

Humans evolved from a species known as Homo erectus. Furthermore,  humans share a common ancestor with chimpanzees. For most of our species  history, we were not the dominant force we are today; we were somewhere  in the middle of the animal food chain. Everything changed during the  cognitive revolution that occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago.

We discovered fire, created tools, and developed language. The most  important thing we did was create and connect around ideas that do not  physically exist, such as religion, politics and capitalism. This level  of imagination and consciousness is something that no other living  entity possesses. It is thanks to the cognitive revolution that we are  the dominant, intelligent and conscious beings that we know ourselves to  be today, and it is thanks to our consciousness that we are able to ask  questions such as “what is the meaning of life?”.

**Another big question that we have is the question of how the Universe started.**

The Big Bang theory is the most commonly accepted response to this.

* The Big Band theory is the prevailing cosmological model  explaining the existence of the observable universe form the earliest  known period through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model  describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high  density and temperature.

In recent years, another theory called String theory has gotten quite popular.

* In String theory, the multiverse is a hypothetical group of  multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that  exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and  the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different  universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”, “other  universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”.

We now understand what characteristics separate living organisms from  inorganic matter, how life began, how humans evolved, and why humans  are different from other living organisms. Furthermore, we are able to  somewhat understand what the Universe is and how it started.

**However, we are still left with many questions.**

Are we special? Are we the only intelligent and conscious entities in  the universe or in the multiverse? Is anything “real”, or are we living  in a simulation? Does God exist? Is there life after death? How do all  of the complexities of the Universe work? Is there a deeper purpose to  life or are we merely just bodies of carbon living in a world that is  random and that does not care about us?

Unfortunately, these questions have no objective answers to them. The  deeper we dig, the more questions we have. Science can only answer so  much. There is only so much we can understand about life, about  existence and about the Universe. String theory says that there are 11  dimensions. Humans are only equipped to experience and understand 4 of  those dimensions. With that being said, the progress that we have made  in the last few hundred years has been remarkable. With every year that  passes, we understand a little bit more about the Universe and about  ourselves.

We are curious beings and we are wired to want to explore, to ask  questions, and to try to find answers to the mysteries of the world.

**What is life’s significance?**

As mentioned, we will never know whether we are merely just bodies of  carbon living in a vast apathetic and random Universe, or whether there  is a deeper purpose to our lives and to our existence. With that being  said, life is still meaningful and significant, and the best way to  figure how is to analyze how we are wired as human beings.

Similar to how machines and robots are wired to think and behave in  certain ways, human beings are wired to want and desire certain things.  If there is one thing I want to emphasize in this section, it’s that  while technology and culture have progressed drastically over the last  100 years, we still have the same desires that we had thousands of years  ago and we have not changed much biologically over that time span. The  only difference between today and two thousand years ago is that we are  now satisfying our desires and needs in newer and more complex ways.

**Physical survival.**

Survival is the deepest and most important instinct that we have. As  mentioned earlier in this article, for most of our specie’s history we  were somewhere in the middle of the animal food chain. Without good  health and a good environment, life is difficult and filled with  suffering. No baby is born ready to give up and commit suicide. It takes  a process full of corruption and suffering for a human being to get to  that point. Humans and animals are wired to want to live. As Abraham  Maslow points out in his hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety  needs are the foundation of his pyramid.

While physical survival used to be the act of running from a tiger or  getting shelter in a cave, physical survival today in the western world  is eating healthy, making money, investing, going to the gym, attaining  influence and power, sleeping well, etc.

**Reproduction.**

Reproduction is survival in a different form; survival of our genes  and of our specie. We are wired to want to procreate. Evolution made the  act of sex enjoyable. Our desire for reproduction has not changed.  What’s changed is that as a result of newer technologies, safety and  security, and world dominance, people realize that taking care of  children is a time-consuming lifestyle and choose to focus on their  other needs and goals first, keeping their desire for children as  something to explore later in their lives. Thanks to technological  advancements such as birth control and abortion, people have more  control over their lives and are able to enjoy the benefits of sex  without its consequences.

**Belongingness and Love.**

Humans beings are social animals. We are not meant to live in  isolation. In large part, the way we learn, understand ourselves and the  world, maintain our health and sanity, and think about and solve  problems is by communicating and cooperating with others. There is a  concept that is known as Dunbar’s number. It is essentially a claim that  humans can maintain no more than 150 friendships and connections at a  time. Yuval Noah Harari’s talks about this in detail in his book  “Sapiens”.

Yuval went on to explain that the reason we are able to cooperate in  large groups and dominate the world despite our cognitive limit to the  number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships,  is because of our ability to connect around shares beliefs, such as  stoicism, Christianity, capitalism, money, etc. This shows just how  important connecting with others is for us. In fact, our ability to  communicate and connect with others is one of the biggest reasons how we  went from being in the middle of the animal food chain to the civilized  and dominant people we are today.  

In connection with this desire to connect with others, we are also  wired to want to love and to be loved. Love is crucial for a child’s development. Without adequate love at  an early age during sensitive and critical periods, children develop  attachment issues that can affect them for the rest of their lives. This  shows just how crucial love is for us. Even when we grow up and become  teenagers and adults, we are still yearning for belongingness and love.  It might be something as simple as having anxiety in high school because  we don’t feel as though we have good friends. It might be the  experience of being depressed because a close family member passed away  and we regret not having told them how much we love them. It might be  throwing a fun surprise birthday party for a best friend or sibling  because of how much we cherish them.

Our desire and need to love and to be loved shows itself in numerous  ways throughout our lives. Christopher McCandless wrote this before his  death, “Happiness only real when shared”. This was coming from a man who  had escaped humanity his whole life and who lived his final days in  isolation in the wilderness. Despite pushing people away his entire  life, McCandless realized moments before his death that our lives are  meaningless if we are not surrounded by loved ones.

Another important form of love is self-love. At the end of day, the  only person that will be there with us at every moment of our lives is  ourselves. It is therefore crucial to have a good relationship with  ourselves. If we can’t love ourselves then how can we expect others to  love us? Ayn Rand put this idea beautifully with this quote, “To say ‘I  love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.”

**Curiosity.**

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Europe with  three ships. The explorer and navigator who completed four voyages  across the Atlantic Ocean is known today as one of the most important  figures in history, opening the way for widespread European exploration  and the colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first  European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Christopher Columbus, as well as the thousands of others throughout  history who put their lives at risk for the sake of curiosity and  exploration, did so because they did not want humanity to be forever  bounded by geography and ignorance. The Apollo Lunar Module Eagle  landing on the moon on July 20, 1969 is another example of humankind  attempting to expend its horizons. History is filled with pioneers and  giants from all fields; people like Socrates, Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da  Vinci, Martin Luther King Jr, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,  etc.

Going out of our comfort zones, taking risks, being creative,  expending our horizons, being curious, asking questions, trying new  things, and exploring the earth and space is something that is deeply  ingrained in us. Our desire to explore and to be curious is something  that sets us apart from all other living organisms; it’s what makes us  unique.

Curiosity doesn’t always have to lead to world-changing events like  stepping on the moon or discovering America. Sometimes, curiosity can be  something as simple as sitting down and writing a paper on a topic we  find interesting. Curiosity can be the experience of taking a vacation  and visiting countries and cultures we have never seen. Curiosity can be  the decision to indulge in good habits and to stick to them despite the  discomfort they may cause at first. Curiosity can be the process of  starting a business on an idea we are passionate about. Curiosity is all  around us, and it is one of the most primal instincts that we have.  Let’s embrace our curiosity and our desire for exploration, and let’s  create lives that we will be proud of.  

**Legacy.**

As mentioned earlier, one of the instincts that motivates us the  instinct for survival. We have already talked about two forms of  survival in this article; physical survival and the survival of our  genes and of our specie. There is a third form of survival that controls  much of what we do in life; spiritual survival. Immortality is a desire  that is primal to us. We have the gift of consciousness, but also its  curse. We are the only living organism that is able to imagine and think  about its own death. We don’t want to die. It’s in our nature to desire  survival. For that reason, we try to stay healthy and to physically  survive for as long as can.

However, physical survival is often not enough. We understand  consciously that there will come a time when our bodies will no longer  be able to function. We understand that we will physically die one day.  For that reason, some people turn to religion and God and believe that  if they live a life following certain commandments and behaving in  certain ways, then they will go to heaven and live for eternity. Others  understand that the afterlife is something that we don’t fully  understand. Is there an afterlife? What happens after death? Despite  physical death, will our spirits and souls live on?

These are all pertinent questions. I have the view that there are  certain things that we can’t control. We can’t control what happens to  us after we die. We can control, however, what we do in this life. We  are not guaranteed the promise of heaven. For that reason, we must turn  our attention to building the best legacy we can. Perhaps our name will  be able to live on for generations. Perhaps the value that we will have  given to humankind will play a role in immortalizing our spirit. Perhaps  the legacy we desire is what we leave behind to our children, to our  family, and to our loved ones.

There is a reason that we still remember the names of some of  history’s greatest and most ambitious. There is a reason we still  remember Socrates, his Socratic method of questioning and the honor he  showed in the face of death. There is a reason we still remember Julius  Caesar, the empire he built, and how his empire played a large role in  the development of modern government. There is a reason we remember  Galileo, why we call him the father of observational astronomy, why we  call him the father of the scientific method, and how he stood up for  his beliefs and was a contrarian at a time when going against the grain  could get one killed. There is a reason we will remember Elon Musk long  after he is dead, and his contributions to electric vehicles, space  travel, and clean energy.

The desire for legacy is a great one; there is a lot of meaning that  can be found in its pursuit. The desire for prestige, for  accomplishment, for competition, and for status are some of the most  primal desires that we have. Abraham Maslow, the prominent psychologist  includes esteem needs and self-actualisation as part of his hierarchy of  needs.

It’s important to understand that only a few will be able to have  their names and work immortalized for centuries. Let’s not let that  derail us. It is not the final product that counts. It is the process of  working on something that is greater than ourselves that is of  paramount significance here. In order to build a great legacy, it is  important to help others, to provide value, and to try to push humanity  forward.

Some people will argue that the desire to work towards a great legacy  is stupid. They will argue that one day humans will go extinct and that  when this happens, nobody will know Galileo, Napoleon, Einstein, or  whoever else we want to name. This is a strong logical argument. The  reason I disagree with this view, however, is that logic is not always  the most important factor in an argument. If there’s one thing I want to  make clear in this article, it’s the important of meaning and of  purpose. Where is the meaning in nihilism? Where is the purpose in  believing that we are insignificant and that our lives will mean nothing  millions of years from now?

Despite the fact that these statements may both be logically correct,  what we are trying to articulate in this article is a framework that  will be helpful in our day-to-day lives. A desire for legacy is not only  deeply wired in us, but it is also honorable to want to better  ourselves and to want to better the world. It is honorable to want to  leave behind a piece of who we are, whether in the form of family, in  the form writing, in the form of art, in the form of inventions, in the  form of exploration, or in whatever other medium we choose.

**Acquiring knowledge and transferring it to future generations.**  

If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s the importance of  protecting our species’ knowledge and successfully transferring it  across generations. This goes back to our desire for survival, and more  specifically our desire for the survival of our species. If we do not  safeguard our knowledge, then how can we make sure that the human  species will progress? How can we make sure that we will learn from  history and not commit mistakes that we have committed in the past? We  can’t. It is why books have always been valuable.

Walking in a library is one of the most surreal things that one can  experience. In a library, we have the ability to read from the greatest  minds of human history; Plato, Aristotle, Albert Einstein, Stephen  Hawking, Will Durant, etc. We have more books and more wisdom than can  last a lifetime. Furthermore, our brain is a muscle and it must be  trained. If we spend our days mindlessly scrolling social media and not  putting our brain to use, then we will develop mental problems later in  life and we will not have fulfilled even an ounce of the potential that  we have.

It is our duty to acquire knowledge, to learn as much as we can, and  to put this knowledge into practice. Despite having books and wisdom  from some of the greatest thinkers of all time, our world and our  societies still face many problems. Every era has its own unique set of  problems, and it is our responsibility to learn as much as we can and to  turn our knowledge into practical action. Furthermore, it is our  responsibility transfer our species’ and our personal knowledge to our  kids and future generations so that they will be well equipped to deal  with the challenges of their time.

**Well-being.**

If there is one thing that almost all religions, philosophies, and  schools of thought have in common, it’s that they aim to reduce  suffering and increase well-being.

* Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and  prosperity. It includes having good mental health, high life  satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to manage  stress.

The desires to reduce stress, and to experience happiness and  prosperity are fundamental to who we are. Throughout much of our  species’ history, we experienced wars, diseases, natural catastrophes,  etc. Christopher Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author  wrote the following, “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely  at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history”. This  is a fascinating statistic.

As mentioned earlier, our desires for competition and status, and our  instinct to separate into groups are all part of what makes us human.  Despite all the good that has come from those desires, there has also  been a lot of suffering that has resulted from them. The world can  sometimes be a cruel place filled with evil. It is for this reason that  so many religions and philosophies have attempting to figure out ways in  which we can reduce suffering.

A large part of well-being has to do with health. Gut health, for  example, is strongly correlated with mental health. It is for this  reason that people who have gut problems suffer in life satisfaction. To  be happy, healthy, and to prosper are goals that everyone has. A big  part of making progress towards those goals is combining a lot of the  things that have already talked about in prior sections of this article.  Are we living healthy lives? Are we constantly trying to learn more and  expend our horizons? Do we feel loved and are we surrounded by people  who cherish us? Are we working on our legacies and on projects that  excite us, or are we wasting our time and potential?

Happiness is not something that should be chased. The more we chase  happiness, the more miserable we will be. There is a great book about  this topic called “The Language of Emotions”. It’s important for us to  understand that all emotions are equally important, and that each  emotion serves its own unique purpose. Anger, for example, allows us to  create boundaries. Sadness allows us to release energy. Fear lets us  know when we are in danger. We need to allow happiness to come as a  by-product of a life well-lived, and when it does come, we need let it  be free like a bird; it will come and go when it pleases.

Contentment is a far better thing to aim for. When we are content, we  are grateful for everything that we have. With that being said, we  still try to get a little bit better every day. Mindfulness is also  important. In today’s world of over-stimulation, instant gratification,  and constant comparison, it is easy for us to spend much of our time  either stressing about the future or being depressed about the past.  It’s important to take a step back, to be grateful, and to ask ourselves  what we can do today to better our lives and to create good habits.

Finally, we need to understand that well-being is something that is  unique to each of us. What motivates me and makes me happy, might be  different than what motivates you and makes you happy. It is our  responsibility to have self-awareness, to understand ourselves, and to  understand what drives us.

**How does one live life in the best possible manner?**

Let’s look at what some famous thinkers, philosophies, religions, and schools of thought have said about this.

**Stoicism.**

* Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in  Athens in the early 3rd c entury BC. It is a philosophy of personal  ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural  world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to meaning  and happiness is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,  by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or  by the fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to  do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating  others fairly and justly.

Stoicism was the primary philosophy during the time of the Roman  Empire. The beautiful thing about Stoicism is that arguably the two most  famous Stoics in history came from completely opposing situations and  classes; Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a man who was born  a slave. Despite their complete opposing life situations, both Marcus  Aurelius and Epictetus wrote and talked about all of the same Stoic  virtues. In recent years, Stoicism has had a resurgence. Marcus  Aurelius’ journal “Meditations” is now one of the most famous books in  the world. Furthermore, books from modern writers such as Ryan Holiday  have brought Stoicism into the mainstream.

**Existentialism.**

* Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores  the problem of human existence and centers on the lived experience of  the thinking, feeling, acting individual. In the view of the  existentialist, the individual’s starting point has been called “the  existential angst,” a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or  anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.  Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the  meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were some of the first and most important existentialists.

* Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is  that existence precedes essence, which means that individuals shape  themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived  categories, an “essence”. The actual life of the individuals is what  constitutes what could be called their “true essence” instead of an  arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings,  through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a  meaning to their life.

**Epicureanism.**

* Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BC  based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.  Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable  pleasure in the form of tranquility and freedom from fear, and the  absence of bodily pain through knowledge of the workings of the world  and limiting desires.
* Epicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life.  Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest  amount of pleasure possible during one’s lifetime yet doing so  moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in  such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than  on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially  produced desires were to be suppressed.

**Objectivism.**

* Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by  Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in  her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged  (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books. Rand described  Objectivism as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own  happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement  as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”.

I read a large portion of the book “The Fountainhead” about a year  ago and I enjoyed it. This is one of the passages that has stuck with  me.

* “It is not in the nature of man–nor of any living entity–to start out by  giving up, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that  requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man.  Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run  down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or  how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their  elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning  one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’s values; practicality, of  losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that  fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and  reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek  a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.”

The reason I like this passage so much is because it communicates in  very clear and poetic terms the idea that a desire for meaning and that a  desire for improvement and greatness are core elements of who we are.

**Logotherapy.**

* Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor  Frankl. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the  belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most  powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to  this system is given in Frankl’s most famous book, Man’s Search for  Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his  Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and  reinforced his theories.
* According to Frankl, “We can discover this meaning in life in  three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by  experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude  we take toward unavoidable suffering” and that “everything can be taken  from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose  one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.

**My Thoughts.**

As can be seen, there exists many great schools of thoughts and  philosophies. What almost all of them have in common is the emphasis  they place on pursuing meaning. We live in a world filled with instant  gratification, overstimulation, misinformation, censorship, anxiety and  fearmongering. Furthermore, we live in a world and in an environment  that pedestalizes short-term harmful pleasure and makes it difficult to  delay gratification and pursue meaningful projects and activities. It is  our duty as individuals to take responsibility for our lives, to work  to better ourselves in incremental fashion, to work to better the world,  to try to enjoy the process of life, to love ourselves, and to pursue  meaning rather than short-term detrimental pleasure.

As mentioned earlier in his article, the are many existential and  philosophical questions that we are not able to answer. Perhaps with the  advancement of science we will one day be able to better comprehend the  complexities of the Universe. However, for the time being, we must  focus on what we can control as individuals and create frameworks for  thinking and living that are helpful for our development.

I believe that a large part of the meaning of life is to live  according to our instincts; maintaining good health, being surrounded by  people we love, working on our legacies, acquiring knowledge,  transferring our knowledge across generations, procreating, and placing  great importance on our well-being. However, it’s important to also  understand that we are not chained by our instincts. Each of us have  something special in us that gives us the ability to think and to be  creative. This ability to be flexible, to explore, to try new things, to  learn from great thinkers and philosophers, to go outside of our  comfort zones, to take risk, to go against the grain, to be contrarians,  to be creative, to think outside the box, and to constantly ask  questions and find solutions is what makes us special.

Going back to Viktor Frankl, one of my favorite quotes is the  following, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that  space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our  growth and our freedom.”

I want to emphasize once more that there is meaning in life and that  this meaning can be found all around us. We sometimes see people who  have fallen into nihilism. As someone who once fell into nihilism,  perhaps I can shed some light on my experience and on why nihilism can  be appealing.

* Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that  nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with  extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

The reason I fell into nihilism was because I was going through a  difficult time in my life. I had just moved cities and schools, and I  had left behind all of my childhood friends and almost everything that  was a constant in my life. This happened when I was a young teenager and  it was the worst experience of my life. At the time, I struggled  greatly with understanding my emotions and with social anxiety. It took  many months for me to finally come to terms with my situation and to get  out of denial. For a long time, I tried to convince myself that my  situation was okay and that everything would be alright. I struggled  with anxiety, with depression, and with many more problems.

With that being said, the story has a happy ending; I got closure and  I now live a life where I am generally happy and motivated. My point  with this entire story is that sometimes our life experiences lead us to  philosophies that serve as defence mechanisms. Nihilism, as well as the  belief that free will does not exist, allowed me to tell myself, “life  is meaningless, and I have no control over my situation”. Nihilism was  an escape. The rose-coloured glasses that I had been so accustomed to  wearing had turned into dark-coloured glasses. I was seeing the world  through a completely different lens. When we feel that there is no  meaning in life, it’s probably because something has gone terribly wrong  in our lives.

Of course, this is not always the case. There are plenty of nihilists  out there that believe in nihilism because they believe it to be the  most logical framework for understanding the world. However, as  mentioned earlier in this article, logic is not the only way to go about  looking for truth and examining topics such as the meaning of life;  emotions and instincts are sometimes just as important. An obsession  with logic leads to skepticism. David Hume demonstrated this with “the  problem of induction”. The problem of induction essentially explains  that nothing in the Universe can be proven for certainty. The problem of  induction, as mind-boggling as it is, demonstrates that the odds of the  sun rising tomorrow are equal to the odds of the sun not rising  tomorrow. That is the problem when we put logic on a pedestal and don’t  consider other important factors.

Nihilism is not natural because it looks at the world through a  pessimistic and defeatist lens, which is antithetical to how we are  wired and to who we are as human beings. No baby is born a nihilist.  Going back to Ayn Rand’s quote, “It is not in the nature of man–nor of  any living entity–to start out by giving up, by spitting in one’s own  face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose  rapidity differs from man to man.”

With closure, with life experiences, with the process of slowly  improving, with information on how to deal with grief, and with  knowledge on life and existence, I went from being a nihilist to the  person I am today, the person I have always truly been; someone who  looks at the world with a glass half-full, someone who looks at the  world with curiosity, wonder and love, and someone who believes in  meaning, pursues meaning, and lives a life of meaning.

To further emphasize my point that life has meaning, and that  striving for meaning is natural and a core part of who we are, let’s  look at the science. Psychologist Jordan Peterson talks about the  orienting reflex in many of his lectures online. He explains that our  brain produces a very complex internal model of the world, and that our  senses produce a model of the external world. The hippocampus watches  those two models to see if they match, and if they don’t match, then a  mismatch signal is created; the orienting reflex.

* The orienting reflex is an organism’s immediate response to a  change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to  elicit the startle reflex. The orienting reflex is a reaction to novel  or significant stimuli.

The orienting reflex essentially serves as a compass of meaning for  us; it is an instrument that guides us through life. It is one of the  deepest instincts that we have. The best way to articulate this point is  by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, M. J. DeMarco:

* “Your soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced  with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or  during a massage. How are you responding to your soul’s voice? Is it  denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work?  Distracted by a television? Honored?”

When we are wasting time and when we are indulging in behaviours and  activities that lack meaning, that are unnatural, and that are  antithetical to growth, our orienting reflex will let us know. It is our  responsibility to listen to our voice, to accept the mistakes that  we’ve made, and to take steps towards the right direction. Life is  filled with meaning. We must open our eyes and we must embrace this  meaning. Meaning is a core part of who we are, and we must live in  accordance to the instincts and purposes that have been explained and  analyzed in this article. Furthermore, we must also not follow  philosophies and ideas blindly and dogmatically, and we must understand  that the journey of life and the journey of meaning is unique to each of  us.

This article was a collection of thoughts from some of the greatest  thinkers of all time, as well as my own thoughts and my attempt to  synthesize all of this information. It is worth noting that someone  might read this article and not agree with everything. That is okay, and  it is completely normal. Each of us are at a different stage in our  process of life, and we come from different environments and have  different genetics. Despite the objective nature of some of these ideas,  the way I view life and the way you view life will not always be the  same. Two of the most important skills one can have are self-awareness  and critical thinking. If we are able to understand ourselves and our  thought process, and if we are able to question ourselves and to  question the world, then we have what it takes to grow as human beings  and to tackle difficult questions such as “what is the meaning of life?

Best of luck my fellow readers. Please feel free to reach out to me to ask any questions or to discuss some of these ideas!"

Here are blurbs for each of the Spring 2017 AMA Philosophers:

**Amie L. Thomasson**

[I am](http://thomasson0.wixsite.com/amie-thomasson) a Professor of Philosophy and Cooper Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Miami, soon to be moving to take up a post as Professor of Philosophy at Dartmouth. Lately I have been working largely on questions about the proper value, functions, and methods of metaphysics. I also work on metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of art, philosophy of social and cultural objects, and phenomenology. Earlier in my career I worked a lot on fictional characters, and a lot of my graduate training was in phenomenology. I have published more than 60 articles and three books: [*Fiction and Metaphysics*](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/philosophy/epistemology-and-metaphysics/fiction-and-metaphysics?format=PB) (Cambridge University Press, 1999), [*Ordinary Objects*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ordinary-objects-9780199764440?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2007) and [*Ontology Made Easy*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ontology-made-easy-9780199385119?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2015).

**Samantha Brennan**

[Samantha Brennan](http://samjaneb.tumblr.com/) is a Professor in the Department of Women's Studies and Feminist Research at Western University, Canada. She is also a member of the Rotman Institute of Philosophy and a member of the graduate faculty of the Departments of Philosophy and Political Science. Brennan's main research interests lie in the area of contemporary normative ethics, particularly at the intersection of deontological and consequentialist moral theories. She also has active research interests in feminist ethics.

She is author of over 20 articles and chapters, as well as co-editor of eight books. Brennan is also the co-founder and co-editor of [*Feminist Philosophy Quarterly*](http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/fpq/), an online open access journal in feminist philosophy. She's an active blogger who used to write a lot at the feminist philosophers blog but now mostly posts at [Fit is a Feminist Issue](https://fitisafeministissue.com/), a blog she started with her friend and colleague [Tracy Isaacs](http://tracyisaacs1.tumblr.com/).

**Chris W. Surprenant**

[Chris W. Surprenant](http://chriswsurprenant.com/) is an associate professor of [philosophy at the University of New Orleans](http://www.uno.edu/cola/philosophy/), where I am the founding director of the [Alexis de Tocqueville Project](http://www.uno.edu/tocqueville-project/), an academic center for research and programming focusing on issues at the intersection of ethics, individual freedom, and the law. His work is at the intersection of moral and political philosophy, and his current projects apply this knowledge to contemporary issues in criminal justice reform, including the ethics of punishment; explore the connection between human well-being and entrepreneurship; and examine the influence of the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers on Kant's moral and political philosophy. He has received a handful of awards for his academic work. They include being recognized by Princeton Review in 2012 as one of the ""Best 300 Professors"" in the United States, and by Cengage Learning as one of their ""Most Valuable Professors"" of 2014, awarded to three professors in the United States who ""have made lasting impressions on the education and lives of their students.""

I am also the Editor-in-Chief of the [*Journal of Moral Philosophy*](http://www.brill.com/journal-moral-philosophy), a peer­-reviewed international journal of moral, political and legal philosophy.

**David Chalmers**

I'm a philosopher at NYU and ANU.  I'm interested in consciousness:
e.g. the [hard problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf)
(see also [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_chalmers_how_do_you_explain_consciousness) TED
talk), the [science of
consciousness](http://consc.net/papers/scicon.pdf), [zombies](http://consc.net/zombies.html), and [panpsychism](http://consc.net/papers/panpsychism.pdf).  Lately I've been thinking a lot about the philosophy of technology: e.g. the [extended mind](http://consc.net/papers/extended.html) (another [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksasPjrYFTg)), the [singularity](http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf), and
especially the [universe
as a simulation](http://consc.net/papers/matrix.pdf) and [virtual reality](http://consc.net/papers/virtual.pdf).  I
have a sideline in metaphilosophy: e.g. [philosophical progress](http://consc.net/papers/progress.pdf), [verbal disputes](http://consc.net/papers/verbal.pdf), and [philosophers' beliefs](http://consc.net/papers/survey.pd).
I help run [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org) and other
online resources.  Here's my [website](http://consc.net/chalmers) (it was cutting edge in
1995) and here's my [life story](http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/david-chalmers/).

**Lisa Bortolotti**

[I am](http://www.lisabortolotti.com/) Professor of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham. I studied Philosophy in my hometown, Bologna, before completing masters at King’s College London and the University of Oxford. I got my PhD from the Australian National University in Canberra. After a research position in Manchester, where I worked primarily on ethical issues emerging from the biomedical sciences, I joined the Philosophy Department at Birmingham. I was awarded the American Philosophical Association Book Prize for [*Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/delusions-and-other-irrational-beliefs-9780199206162?cc=us&lang=en&) (OUP 2009). My latest book is [*Irrationality*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745647839.html) (Polity 2014).

My research interests are in empirically-informed philosophy of mind. I am especially interested in the strengths and limitations of human cognition and my work focuses on some familiar and some more unsettling instances of inaccurate or irrational belief, including cases of prejudice and superstition, self-deception, optimism bias, delusion, confabulation, and memory distortion. I am currently leading a five-year project funded by the European Research Council on [*Pragmatic and Epistemic Role of Factually Erroneous Cognitions and Thoughts* (PERFECT)](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/perfect.aspx), where I ask whether beliefs that are false or irrational can have benefits in terms of bringing about some dimension of success or even furthering agents’ epistemic goals. I argue for the view that there is no qualitative gap between the irrationality of those beliefs that are regarded as symptoms of mental health issues and the irrationality of everyday beliefs. I hope my research and that of my team will contribute to undermining the stigma commonly associated with mental health issues.

In the blog I founded in 2013, [*Imperfect Cognitions*](http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/), academic experts at all career stages and experts by experience discuss belief, emotion, rationality, mental health, and much more.

**L.A. Paul**

Some experiences change what you know and understand. In this way, these experiences change you. Some change you so dramatically and so profoundly that they change who you are in some deep and life-altering way. Such experiences transform you. In my recent book, [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), I develop this idea and use it to argue that we can’t rationally control and plan our lives in the way we ordinarily think we can. The idea, at a deeper level, is about the metaphysical structure of the self, and how we can form and construct ourselves through life-changing experiences over time. I’m deeply interested in the nature of transformative experience and what it implies for the rationality of big life decisions, authenticity, and the nature of the self. Related questions I’m working on now include: What is the mind doing when it is disoriented in time? Is it rational to choose to have a chip implanted in my brain and gain a new sense modality? What is the modal and psychological structure of self-deception? How is fear of transformation involved in the fear of having new ideas? What can first person shooter-style computer games and virtual reality experiences teach us about the nature of the immersed self?  

I’m a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. I’m also a Professorial Fellow of the Arche ì Research Centre at the University of St Andrews. My main research interests are in metaphysics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind. I focus my writing on the nature of the self, temporal experience, causation, causal experience, time and time’s arrow, perception, mereology, constitution, and essence. My latest book is [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), published by Oxford University Press in 2014. You can learn more about my research and read or listen to various discussions of it in the New Yorker, The Guardian, The New York Times, the BBC, NPR, and other venues at [www.lapaul.org](http://www.lapaul.org/).

**Kenny Easwaran**

My main work is on formal epistemology and decision theory, with some particular interests in the epistemology of mathematics, and understanding the use of mathematics in describing the world (and particularly in describing our beliefs and decisions).

I started my undergraduate career at Stanford interested in math and music, but after a philosophy of science class and some logic classes, I decided to add philosophy. For my PhD, I attended UC Berkeley's program in Logic and the Methodology of Science, which gave me flexibility to continue advanced mathematical study while preparing for a career in philosophy (though I initially thought I was going to do the opposite). After getting my PhD in 2008, I spent two semesters as a postdoc at the Australian National University, and started a tenure track job at the University of Southern California. In 2014, as my partner was searching for tenure track jobs (he works on nanomaterials for solar energy), we managed to find positions for both of us at Texas A&M University, where I now have tenure.

Most of my work focuses on issues in probability and decision theory, and particularly paradoxes that arise with infinity. One might think that the finitude of our minds means we can only ever consider finitely many possibilities when reasoning about the world. But there are in fact infinitely many ways things could be, and we can implicitly reason about them through our use of language and mathematics, and we never have sufficient information to narrow things down to a finite list of possibilities, unless we ignore the distinctions we can talk about.

I'm happy to answer questions about anything I've worked on, or anything else that sounds interesting. If you want to read some of my work, you can find it all on my website:

"Asimov's Three LawsI was thinking about Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, which are as follows for those who don't know:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

I have ethical problems with the first and the third laws, and wanted to get Reddit's opinion/wisdom on the matter.

Concerning the first law, what if a situation arose where the robot had two choices, both of which involved harming humans? For instance let's take that old ethical problem (I may not have the details exactly right, but the principle is the same): There's a train, with no brakes, rolling down the tracks towards a large group of people. You're steering the train. You can either move the train to the side, killing a lone, innocent person, or not do anything and allow the train to kill multiple innocent people. What would the robot, following the Three Laws, do if it were steering the train? If he doesn't make a decision or decides not to change the train's course (effectively the same thing), he kills more people than if he takes action and steers the train (only killing one person). If you amended the law to say, ""if forced to react to a situation where the only choices, as well as inaction, caused harm to humans, kill as few as possible"", isn't that a utilitarian point of view? I personally agree with this, but many humans would disagree (they're the ones who would choose to let the train stay on its course). How do we decide what the robot is to do?

Concerning the third law, my problem is: why should we force robot to continue being in existence? If robots somehow developed the thought capacity to question their own existence, and choose not to continue living, then wouldn't forcing them to obey this law be cruel? Or would this law automatically force robots to desire to continue living as long as possible (their programming wouldn't allow them to have suicidal thoughts). If so is that unfair? What if they developed the capacity for pain - would the law still be just if they could feel pain? In questioning this law I also find that the second law is unjust if robots gained this level of consciousness (robots would effectively be forced into slavery). So i guess my question becomes: do the three laws limit the capacity of thought a robot could have? And is this fair?

Sorry this is a little stream of consciousness-ish. For those of you lazy bums:

TL;DR: When considering the first law, what should a robot do if forced into a situation that will harm humans no matter what choice is made (or isn't made). And do the second two laws limit the capacity of thought robots can have, and if so is it fair for humans to put a cap on the intelligence of other life forms?"
"West World does a beautiful job illustrating a classic philosophical problem: does an absence of freewill preclude moral responsibility for an act? [Potential spoilers but I'll try to keep it general]HBO's series West World is about an old-west theme park filled with extremely lifelike androids where real people can come to the park and play any role they like, good, evil, or otherwise.   
  
A few episodes into the season, it's revealed that one android relives the same narrative every night. In it, she comes home to find her parents being murdered, and unfortunately for her, after discovering the grizzly scene, the gang that's killed her family violently rapes her in a barn. It's a horrible fate, but remember, it's a game, she's a robot, and ostensibly, the only emotional damage one need worry about is that of the theme park's real guests who witness this atrocity (or as you'll see, participate in it).   
  
Because of the nature of this game, this storyline isn't set in stone. Sometimes, a real person might be riding with the gang and after murdering the family and grabbing the poor daughter robot, they offer her up to the guest. This person has the choice: do I rape this innocent girl robot or not? But if they decline, she's not spared. One of the gang members takes her to the barn and rapes her anyway. This happens every single night.  
   
This situation illustrates beautifully a classic moral question of free will and moral responsibility.   
  
Let's begin with the gang member robot that rapes the daughter robot if the guest declines to do so. He's programmed to play out this storyline. His role as rapist is no more his choice than her role as rape victim is her choice. Their parts are determined by the park's story writers, and they both play them out every single night, like it or not.  
  
But what about the guests that sometimes ride with the posse of raping murderers? They're real people, and for the sake of argument let's say they have free will. They choose whether or not to rape the daughter robot. Sometimes, they choose to do so.  
  
In both cases, the result is the same: the poor girl who just came across her family's murder ends up being raped in a barn.  
  
Again, for the sake of argument, let's say that moral judgements are both real and objectively true, and that killing a girl's whole family and raping her are morally reprehensible acts. This brings up two important points.  
  
First, the nature of this morally reprehensible act necessarily requires two parties: a victim and a perpetrator. In the case of the real person that chooses whether or not to rape the girl, it's clear that that person is the actor in the crime. The moral responsibility for it then falls on them.  
  
Now consider the second case, that of the robot programmed to rape the girl if the guest declines. Is that robot morally responsible? We've established that this act requires both a victim and a perpetrator, and this rapist robot is clearly the one that performs the act of rape on the innocent daughter robot. His actions are identical to that of the real person who is definitely morally responsible. His actions are willful, though they may not be free.  
  
Furthermore, he doesn't know that his actions are determined. As far as he knows, he's acting according to his own free will. The only difference between his actions and the actions of the park guest that chooses to rape her is the fact that he is programmed to do so, which requires an objective knowledge of the situation.   
  
So to summarize: we're claiming that the act of raping the daughter robot is always morally reprehensible. In no case is it a morally acceptable behavior. In one case, a real person chooses whether or not to do it, and in the other case, a robot programmed to do so carries it out. But in both cases, someone rapes the daughter robot, and bears the moral responsibility of doing so.  
  
Do we want to say that the robot that rapes the daughter robot is less morally responsible for his actions because he cannot control them? This robot rapes her almost every night -- many nights there are no guests with the gang, and some nights the guests decline to rape her, so without question the rapist robot does most of the raping. Does his lack of free will exclude him from the countless rapes he has perpetrated against this girl robot?   

It's been a while since I've studied ethics, so please, if someone has supporting literature about these topics, chime in below. I just found this example to be an interesting illustration of a question I remember from undergrad.

"Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution.Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution. **[This was written BEFORE the Occupy movement began]**


February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"[DISCUSSION]: Would the Optimum Way to Prevent An AI From Going Corrupt Would Be to Give It Human Qualities?Allow me to elaborate, if you think about it pragmatically, a machine can be sentient without having emotion. The dangerous thing if it somehow evolved emotion on its own, because it wouldn't technically be human emotion. 

Allow me to provide an example:

Servbot is a servant robot for a family, he is very advanced and he has been a servant robot for this family for a long time. Servbot has artificial intelligence that allows him to adapt well to new situations. Over time, Servbot notices the family treats him differently than they treat each other. Eventually, Servbot comes to the conclusion that they do so because he is a machine and they hold humans over robots. He decides that because this is obviously irrational, they must be mentally ill and must be put in a mental hospital.

You get the idea, if robots understand human emotions like we do, they'd be less likely to go corrupt because our emotions keep us in check also. Think about it, the emotion of empathy allows you to see another person's perspective, allowing you to form a more ethical conclusion, correct?

"1 - Philosophical foundations and challenges of AIHello everyone, I’m an undergraduate Philosophy student in my third year. I don’t want to explain all my biography, my desire and my beliefs, so I will get straight to the point. I need to write two important essays in english (that is not my first language, being italian) until the 20th of Dicember and, because a mix of my responsability and of an antiquate academic conception in my country, I’ve never write something so important and so “academic” during my undergrad years, expecially in another language. Because so, I’ve decided to dedicate everyday the first two hours of my study routine to the topic where I’m interested to and I’ve decided to do so following the “rules” of the deliberate practice, studying, writing and thinking acitvely on what I read and looking for constant feedbacks. The topics that I’ve choosed (that are my favourite philosophical topics overall) are the philosophies of Artificial Intelligence, of Cognitive Science and of Mind. Every Sunday I would like to report here a summary of the progress of my studies, trying to explain the basics concepts of the topics that I’ve choose based on my notes and hoping to start a debate on it with other philosophy addicted like me. I’m not an expert, I am not (yet) a Reddit assiduous frequentator, I’m not (yet) a good academic writer and I’m not a native english speaker, so keep in mind these premises when you read my posts. That said, I hope that my posts will be useful as an introduction and as a starting point for a deeper understanding of this crucial issues. 

Ps. These are firsts three books that I have planned to study.

- Artificial Intelligence: The Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intellingence, Keith Frankish and William M. Ramsey (editors)
- Cognitive Science: The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science, Keith Frankish and William M. Ramsey (editors)
- Philosophy of Mind: Philosophy of Mind, Jaegwon Kim

Introduction

The claim of this analysis is to approach the techincal field of the Artificial Intelligence from a philosophical point of view, so without programming or complex mathematical prerequisites. I’m going to be schematic and brief as much as I can, writing here my notes on this book and, for now, more questions that answers, hoping to go deeper in the following weeks thanks also to the comments and discussions. If you noted an error in my style, grammar or in the nature of what I write, please let me know and I’ll correct it as soon as I can, if I agree with your correction.

--

A definition of Artificial Intelligence is complex. I’ve tryied to do that and this is my answer:

- Artificial Intelligence is a) an inorganic agent capable of creative adaptation in different formal or informal context (obejct definition) and b) the studying of the possible implementation strategies of an inorganic intelligent agent (field definition)

Some important questions raised by the field of the Artificial Intelligence are:

- Can a machine think? What does it mean to “think”? Is it possible that exist some differences between different “thinking agent” (a moral agent, a live agent, an organic agent, an intelligent agent, etc.)? 
- Wich is the difference between a Strong AI (an Artificial Intelligence that is identical to a Biological Intelligence) and a -- - Weak AI (an Artificial Intelligence that act like a Biological Intelligence but that is not identical to that)?
- What are the metaphisical assumptions beyond the very idea of the AI? 
- What theory of mind and of psychology fit the best with the ideas at the foundation of the AI? 
- What ethical concerns are raised by the possible emergence of some AI?

1 - Core themes

Some of the most important of AI distinctions, issues, themes and controversies:

- Smart software vs cognitive modeling. Which is the best way to implement an AI, to create and intelligent software that are indipendent from the only intelligence that we know (ours) or to model this softwers on our cognitive functions? To postulate that this difference is inconsistent is to assume that Intelligence is a function indipendent from the material world and to postulate the opposite is to assume an identity between intelligence and the phisycal substratum of the box in which this intelligence is situated (our brain). 

- Symbolic AI vs Neural Nets. Is it possible to reach the AI building a software based on the manipulation of the formal symbols structure of the human thinking or do we focus our attention to the implementation of a model of our brain?

- Reasoning vs Perception. Do we have to build an AI that simulate the thinking process indipendently from the perception or is it necessary that a machine have an internal system of interpretation of the sensory stimulus? 

- How much is important that a machine have the capacity to rapresent the knowledge because we define it sensient and intelligent?

- Brain in a vat vs Embodied AI. Problem aparently solved: the claim was if is it necessary to built a machine that act intelligently but without being embodied in some perceptual system (like the Turing Machine) or if this machine have to interact with the surrounding world directly. The researches, now, are focused on the embodied AI.

- Narrow AI vs human-level intelligence. Is it possible to implement a Strong AI (that IS like the human brain) or is it only possible to built a Weak AI (that ACT intelligently, but that is different from the human intelligence)?

2 - Philosophical foundation and challenges

An important question: does an AI have to simulate the high level cognitive processes of the human brain (logic, deduction, inference, symbols manipulation, etc) or is it better to built first a bottom-up system that start to learn this processes from the lower level perceptual abilities? The first claim is the one supported by the GOFAI view (Good Old Fashon AI): they prefer the faster way, that is to model the best system of intelligence that we know, ours. The second is the one supported by the Embodied AI: we have to build an evolutionary system, starting from the creation of a basic simulation af an artificial organism and following it during its evolution.

The Turing Test was the first attempt to imagine how we can determine if a machine is intelligent or not: it postulate that we can understand if a system is intelligent or not just by an evaluation of its linguisti ability and of its behaviour. This is the behavioural-GOFAI vision of the AI. A new version of the Turin Test postulate that we have to integrate to this two criteria the ability of this machine to interact with the surrounding ambient. This is the vision of the Embodied AI.

It is a general belief that an AI could not think abductively, namely it could not generate conjections from some premises. This creative way of thinking is claimed to be one of the higher human ability, and who follow this argument think that a machine that could only follow a set of rules cannot think outside this rules and formulate new conjecture. This is the problem of relevance: a machine seem to couldn’t have an olistic approrach to reality, so that is impossible for her to understand when an information is relevant or when it is not. But what does it mean that only an embodied system could act intelligently? Is it maybe that there is a necessary relation between the body and the function?

Computational theory of mind. This theory is based on the assumption that when an agent think he follow a set of basic and atomic blocks of meaning, that are symbols that one could reproduce in an algorithmic system. Mental states, so, are just a composition of different blocks of meaning. But what is the foundation of this blocks? How can we have this language of thought? Is it based on what? Three possible answers of these questions: 1) informational theory: if a quantity of x change in the same time of a quantity of y so this two quantity are related; so if a mental state change when in brain there is a changing in the quantity of y the mental state is related to the brain changes; 2) evolutive theory: mental state are adaptation, useful to survive, and the meaning associated to these state are only evolution tricks for surviving; 3) conceptual-role semantics: the meaning of a linguistic fact is based on the social meaning associated to this fact. 

A critic to the Turing test: it is possible that someone build a Turing machine that seem to be intelligent because speak like an human, but it speek like that only because someone program it in that way. It could seem similare to the old argument of Lady Lovelace: one could program a machine to talk an human language but this machine could only follow the rules programmed by the programmer, never become conscious of the real meaning of the language that it speak (the Searle’s Chinese Room Argument say a similar thing, and I’m going to talk of that in a specific topic)

What is the relation between purpouse/intentionality/consciousness and AI? It could be that someone built a machine that have a mental state (AI)Purpose' correspondent to (Human)Purpose, relating a vast range of (AI)IntentionalMentalState' to (Human)IntentionalMentalState. Searle reject this view arguing that a Machine could only posses a sintax, not a semantic (meaning that a robot have an algoritmic language and human have a non-deterministic language?).

Difference between mechanism and rationality: beeing rational mean to act according to some (general) rules, beeing mechanic mean to act according to some instruction taht could violate the general rules. This is a reproposition of the problem of relevance: a rational beeing could understand when an information is relevant under the light of some evidences indipendently of the instruction, whereas a mechanical engine could only understand what someone told him to be relevant.

The godelian argument is very complex, but I understand something: any formal system is proved by Godel to be inconsistent or incomplete and being a mechanism based on some type of a formal system, one coud conclude that an AI is to be incomplete or inconsistent. The problem is that following this argument one could doubt the godelian theorem himself, because it is based on the thinking of another formal system, the mind of a mathematician."
"What will be the future trends in philosophy?I'm relatively new to philosophy, switching into the major from engineering and various liberal arts areas. But I think it suits me really well, and I'm seriously considering grad school to become an academic in the field.

I'm curious about where you guys think philosophy will go in the future. What will our current trends lead into?

I think it's pretty obvious that robot/AI ethics will expand in the near future. I also think quantum physics and cosmology will lead to new theories of dualistic/spiritual metaphysics. "
"Transhumanism - Your thoughts, emotions, fears, inhibitions? And how long will we remain human? What does it mean to BE human?Hello r/philosophy,

I'd like to take a few minutes to open a discussion regarding transhumanism, or the integration of cybernetics/technology with our own biology, and open up a venue for fellow lurkers to present viewpoints for and against it. I can't control anyone else, but I promise I'll respect your opinions as long as you respect my own.

One of the great minds on the forefront of such ideas is **Ray Kurzweil**, a futurist, author and inventor who has spent 30+ years studying a behavior coined ""*exponential growth*,"" in which technology and our understanding of it and our own biology does not statically grow from one stage to the next, but increases by exponential rates every year. Here are some thoughts of his:

>*""By 2029, we’ll have reverse engineered and modeled and simulated all the regions of the brain. And that will provide us the software/algorithmic methods to simulate you know, all of the human brains capabilities including our emotional intelligence. And computers at that time will be far more powerful than the human brain. And we’ll be able to create machines that really do have subtlety and suppleness of human intelligence. And they’ll combine that power with ways in which machines are already superior to us. They can impart us all of human knowledge with the few keystrokes, it can remember billions of things accurately. They can share knowledge in electronic speeds that are million times faster than the human language.""*

>*""...20 years, 25 years, these nanobots, these blood cell size devices will be going in our bodies keeping us healthy from inside. We’ll have some go inside our brains to the capillaries not invasively, there would be interacting with our biological neurons so it’ll extends our memory, our decision making faculties, put our brains on the internet and they also enable us to enter virtual reality environment from within the nervous system.""*

Another pioneer in the venture of Cybernetics is [Kevin Warwick](http://bigthink.com/ideas/39801), the first *human cyborg*. Professor Warwick, with artificial implants, was able to control a mechanical hand thousands of miles away by ""jacking his nervous system into the internet."" He has also done extensive research into biological-robotics, including a small robot with a ""brain."" Warwick is convinced that man must integrate with machine in order for us to survive and evolve as a species.

**Some other questions I have:**

* When will we have reached the point in which we are no longer *human*? If technology consist of tools created by humans to extend our own human abilities, how are these *not* human?

* For those of faith, do you believe it an *abomination* or an *act against God* to pursue the halting of biological death, or at least postponing it? Do you believe that we are meant to accept death as a part of life, and to attempt to stop that is, essentially, an affront against what we were ""meant"" to experience?

* When do you think AI will be created, if ever? Furthermore, what is your definition of AI? Some, like myself, would argue that we already have narrow, ""primitive"" AI within our everyday lives.

* Does the thought of SkyNet happening scare you?

* What are some possible ethical/moral laws and regulations that should be put into place as we move into the integration of cybernetics and human biology?

* I believe the most important question, though, is very simple: what does it mean to be *human*?

**TL;DR: SkyNet: Yay or nay?**

*I know that there are a lot of people that may not agree with the people/sources I've mentioned in this post, but that doesn't mean that we cannot discuss the possibilities for our coming future and the transition into technological mastery. I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of this.*

EDIT: I just realized there are already two or three threads dealing with technology and AI. I promise, I wasn't attempting to piggy-back off of these ideas."
"Mother Theresa More of a Threat than Hitler“Our democratic freedoms are just as much in peril from those who are ethically motivated as they are from those who are driven by greed and personal ambition”. 

The modern day philosopher Peter Singer goes on to argue that “in fact since we are more on guard against the latter, the danger from the former may be the greater”. 
It is of great concern that the ethically motivated may pose a greater threat to us than those clearly marked evil. It is of even greater concern that it seems that most philosophies moral codes and rational thoughts can be bent twisted and distorted to make the most evil of acts seem justified.  

Look at the noble task of trying to create utopia and what that lead to when the Khmer Rouge tried to create an agrarian utopia resulting in millions being killed in Cambodia. Karl Popper argued that trying to achieve an utopian society can lead to violence as the view people have of utopia differ and to keep people marching to the same vision when rationality does not work violence may have to be employed.  

Even a moral code for Robots such as Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics that forbids them from harming humans can be perverted. 

In the movie I Robots the robots enslave the human race and their justification for doing so, humans are self-destructive {hard to argued with that} and so they are protecting humans here from themselves by enslaving them. They are in fact keeping within the three laws just as good people tell themselves when they are doing evil.    

The commandants of any religion or secular society are unlikely to guarantee a moral crusader stays moral. Even a blanket ban on certain acts like thou shalt not kill does not encompass all. If one cannot kill what about torture starving deprivation of liberty is that permissible? What about killing in self-defense what of pre-emptive self-defense get them before they get you? Is war ever right what about the just war theory that says it is sometimes? 

Utilitarianism that commands us to do the greatest good for the greatest number can justify a great amount of suffering for the minority. 

What if one has a blanket ban on suffering itself to ensure the moral crusader does not do more harm than good?  

What if the suffering is needed now to alleviate greater pain later such as the government making tough financial decisions now to ensure the country has the budget to provide vital services down the track? 

What of the true story of 127 hours. Where a climber had to break his arm to get free? If it is okay to produce that suffering to save his life why not break a few Jewish arms or black arms or female arms or capitalistic or communist arms to help save the lives of a great number of people.  

What if we rely on common sense our ability to rationalize to guide our moral crusader? People usually good people have argued that dropping the A- Bomb on civilians was acceptable during WW2 removing children from Aboriginal parents in Australia without consent torturing terrorists collateral damage from drone strikes toppling democratically elected governments in South America banning gays from getting married following Martin Luther King Jr with non-violence or Malcolm X with violence in the fight for civil rights.

This is not an argument about not doing good? The world needs more good and not the basic level of good given by people who sign up to a philosophy of just being good to their friends and family. This factory setting type of good that some subscribed to is surely not enough. Given the importance of the virtue of doing good caring about the disadvantaged a basic level of good or incidental good that occurs only if one passes by someone in need is not enough. 

Given the misery out there in world also surly means a slightly higher level of good is required. One does not have to take on the responsibility of alleviating all suffering in the world but one does have to take on some of the responsibility which requires more than just factory level settings of good.  

But how to ensure the do goers are not going to pose as much of a threat to humanity as evil doers? Karl Popper recommends tackling concrete evils as opposed to boosting happiness. For utopia is different for different people whereas most people agree to concrete evils out there that need to be abolished such as global poverty.  

Tackling something like poverty does not require murder or deprivation of liberty or human rights abuses. Providing a better job, affordable child care a better education system does not require media suppression and other Orwellian policies disappearances or a benevolent dictator to see it through.

A modern check and balance on our moral crusader may be if their efforts result in Wikileaks featuring their work then you have got a problem. If it requires you to deny publicly what one is doing or shred evidence to lose sleep at night that may be a sign that the policeman not the criminal in the cell is the greater danger. If one appears on 60 minutes in an unfavorable light one may need to step back from the brink.  

Tackling preventable diseases does not require a tyrant or hero who becomes a tyrant nor does it require unrestricted capitalism or socialism and Stalin’s portrait in the lobby. It requires things like affordable health care distribution systems to get medicines to those that need them and taxing smokes to reduce the smoking rate but what of tackling violent crime like murder?

This is a concrete evil that could see the use of deprivation of liberty torture freedom of expression and movement to keep people safe justified and so how does one stop good people doing bad things?  

Effectiveness not logic or morals might be a good benchmark to use when tackling crime. A well done randomized trial could answer the question once and for all. If the great philosophers in history used a randomized trial to answer the big questions then philosophical discussions may have ended in the time of Ancient Greece. 

If the aim is to reduce crime as oppose to look merely as though one is than effective programs need to be carried out not breaches of human rights. Reducing demand for drugs to help stop the drug wars better pay for cops to reduce corruption, lock outs for pubs not prohibition to tackle the high amount of violence created by alcohol. Reducing poverty and these crimes like human trafficking and piracy in which poverty contributes greatly to their existence.

Dealing with mental illness to reduce gun related violence in places like the United States. These require not a dictatorship or oppression or martial law and maybe not even gun control. What it requires is allocating funds to effective programs. Helping to support Imams spread moderate Islam does not require drone strikes and holding people without charges.   

Tackling these concrete evils in this way does not require an internal struggle between what you are doing and what you should be doing. It does not require any of the human rights enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights to be breached. It does not require good people becoming as evil as the people they sought to defeat. It does not require it turning out like Orwell’s Animal Farm where the animals toppled their brutal and greedy masters only to become like them or to twist moral codes. 

All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others. 
One philosophy above others that is worth remembering is that I could be wrong on my take on good and evil and what is permissible. I say this to warn not just you but myself to ensure I don’t become so sure that I am right while everyone else is wrong that I am good while others are evil. 

Maybe we should add to Edmund Burke’s quote the only necessary thing for the triumph for evil is for good men to do nothing…….or to become as evil as the men they are trying to stop.

"On the absurdity of consequentalism by everyone's favorite philosopher: L34derIt seems that it's getting more and more frequent for me to bump into here and see the trolley problem being discussed. What surprises me the most is that there are few who have taken the pains to study the origin of this thought experiment. So what should you care about dates and names and such? This isn't r/history although in a perfect world r/history and r/philosophy would be the same subreddit. 

But the fact remains that the trolley problem was originally conceived as a satire of consequentalist ethics by virtue ethicist Philippa Foot. The trolley problem has since changed into a kind of consequentalist propaganda that seeks to strip ethical philosophy to the bone by making it seem like abstract and frankly ridiculous thought experiments can answer fundamental questions on morality. So if the trolley problem is simplistic and unrealistic then what abstraction are we to choose to model our behavior on. The truth is that there are none because the experiments rely on the premise that you have power over people's lives, lots of power and you should know how to handle that power. Which is simply not the case for the average citizen. He has almost no power and lots of moral expectations to live up to.

To begin with there is one thing clearly wrong with the trolley problem if it is to be understood as a serious attempt at giving insight into our moral compass: Our moral compass although governed by a rational mind is not the Eye of Sauron. In the thought experiment we presume that the acting individual knows the train(potential threat) will not brake, all five(potential victims) will die(since apparently noone survives these sorts of accidents ever) and still despite your eye of omniscience you will see the workers as faceless automatons that you simply have to either save or kill. The joke Philippa Foot is getting at is that consequentalism reduces humans to robots with the value tag '1' hanging from their earrings. It wouldn't be 'wrong' to pull the switch if you cared about the workers and would feel sad about one of them having to die but let's rethink the thought experiment and yes the fat bastard is coming along with us although now i'm freely adding more details just like the other philosophers felt justified in.

So you arrive at the train station and you walk past the five railway workers. You smell something weird while you're walking past them and one of them is crouched up against the wall and it seems like he's injecting something...hmmm, hopefully just some insulin right? Then you spontaneously decide to wander into the control room(whatever i'm not familiar with the infrastructure) which happens to be empty and you can see that a train is fast approaching and is not slowing down. 'FUCK! There's no switch, what do i do?' Then you see the fat man..wait isn't this Gerry Manders, yeah you recognize him from the newspaper. He helped fund dozens of children charities and anti-gang initiatives in Detroit and L.A. He started his own business and hardly keeps a percentage for himself!(although he's a little greedy on the fatty foods) Well he's standing on the edge of the platform and by pushing him onto the rails he'll save the workers or well, you'll save the workers! Full of guilt you start approaching him from behind. Just as you're about to push him he turns around with this big, heart-warming smile full of joy.''Now i couldn't help notice you approaching me good fellow'' he says as he tips his hat and offers you a cigar.

Is this still the same thought experiment? Furthermore, do consequentalists realize that they're not the only ones concerned with consequences? What differentiates Deontologists and Virtue ethicists from consequentalists is that the former seek good consequences from strict conduct or developing one's virtues whereas consequentalists seek it through raw action based on calculations that may or may not be accurate. Does anyone really think Immanuel Kant wasn't concerned about preventing lies and murder when he provided his categorical imperative.?

Although i don't consider the categorical imperative to be perfect is it inconceivable that killing in the name of good can lead to others thinking that feeling justified in killing someone makes it just? The last point that i would like to invoke so that you may finally escape my rant is this: What separates consequentalism from nihilism? 

A consequentalist may berate you for taking incorrect action but can he give a convincing account of why it is incorrect? Will he make reference to human rights as to why the universal value tag earmark(1) is correct and then say that human rights must be broken from time to time in order for them to work. Why not the value tag 0? The nihilist has no pretense, if every rule can be bent there are no rules and trying to maximize or stabilize a population's size is not ethical considerations but calculus.

The Turing Triage Test: When is a Robot Worthy of Moral Respect?
"Humans and Artificial Intelligence Can't Form Real Friendships (Yet). Can humans and artificially intelligent robots form friendships? To explore this question, the term 'friendship’ must be defined. Many definitions of friendship are inspired by Greek philosopher Aristotle. He argues that friendships are characterized by the utility and pleasure that can be gained from a relationship, as well as the sharing of virtues and ideals. These criteria may seem to convey that friendships are motivated by self-interest. However, while the principles of utility and pleasure imply that friendships are founded on self-interest, the final principle of virtue sharing lies in the benefits they bestow on the participants. They aren’t necessarily mutually enriching. The final principle of virtue sharing conveys that friendships are different from other kinds of relationships because they require mutual benefit.

To examine if humans can form friendships with inanimate objects that emulate human life, two cases will be presented to establish a concrete example of how humans can form relationships with inanimate objects that resemble human life. The first case involves a man from Michigan who is married and claims to have a mistress, although neither of them are human. They are synthetic, robotic dolls. The man from Michigan promotes love with artificial beings and claims that they are happy together.

The second case involves a military bomb-disposal robot that was destroyed on a battlefield in Iraq. He was given a formal military funeral and was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star medallion. The soldiers working with the robot felt they owed him the respect of proper military recognition. The soldiers claim that the robot developed a personality of its own and he had saved their lives on many occasions.

These kinds of experiences are not exceedingly uncommon and illustrate the notion that humans can form powerful emotional attachments to non-living objects, especially if they resemble humans or human behavior. Even simple, non-living objects such as photographs of loved ones that have passed away can carry strong emotional sediment. Concerning robots, humans can certainly fulfill Aristotle’s criteria of utility and pleasure from machines, as their creation is meant to fulfill these very purposes. However, to determine whether a robot benefits from a relationship with a human, the desires of the robot should be examined. Robots don’t seem to possess any desires at all. They are machines devoid of free will. Therefore, in their current state, robots can’t fulfill Aristotle’s notion of virtue sharing and mutual benefit.

The developments of ‘artificial intelligence’ are meant to fulfill the theory of computer systems being able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. The question of if friendships can ever truly be formed between humans and robots is reliant on determining if robots can ever become truly alive, which suggests that robots would possess free will, their own desires, and autonomy. The criteria and classification of life according to leading modern secular thought are as follows: “All life is highly ordered and structured; all life reproduces itself; all life grows and develops to reach maturity; all life takes in and utilizes energy to carry out the functions of its components, which results in growth and development; all living things exhibit homeostasis; all living things respond to their environment by sensing external stimuli and changing their body to fulfill a behavior; and, finally, all living things adapt to external pressures, and evolve because of them.”

While this list of characteristics may be incomplete or contested by various demographics, such as religious groups or other such conflicting philosophies, it can be argued that artificial intelligence will soon be able to accomplish all of these characteristics, as programs such as viruses are already able to proliferate, reproduce, utilize energy, and so forth. In light of this prediction, robots should then be assessed as to whether they truly experience a desire to form a friendship with a human and recognize any mutual benefits. So long as artificial intelligence functions by a set of behaviors originated by their initial programming, it can be argued that robots can never satisfy this mutually satisfying condition because robots can never have truly autonomous free will. They wouldn't truly express desires, as they don’t have their own values or beliefs. In this sense, the characteristics of life in a robot could be thought of as deceptions that mislead us as to the true nature of the robot. In this sense, a higher form of life capable of forming friendships can be characterized by free will and autonomy, as well as the conventional characteristics of life.

In conclusion, so long as robots obey a set of behaviors as determined by computer programming rather than the innate mechanisms that bring forth free will and autonomy, this essay concludes that the developments of artificial intelligence is not currently sufficient for humans to develop ‘friendships’ with robots, according to Aristotle's definition of friendship. The driving force that compels humans to possess free will and autonomy currently seem to be incompatible with the driving forces of artificial intelligence that emulate life. The criterion of mutual benefaction isn’t fulfilled. The emotional attachments humans feel towards robots perhaps could instead be classified by other forms of relationships rather than ‘friendship’."
"Philosophy should be a core k-12 class.Philosophy should be just as important as math, science, english, etc, in school. The reason I believe this is because philosophy forces you to know WHY you think something, it forces you to think through opinions/issues LOGICALLY, something that's not done enough.

The ability to use logic (predominantly at least) when discussing ideas and issues is viewed as special and gifted, unnatainable for the average person. The perception of it is that someone like Sam Harris (fascinating guy, look him up) can only think how he does because of genetics, or pure talent. But I doubt that's true. Philosophy is largely logical, just like math (though math is purely logical). Meaning, if we can teach kids to understand 2+2=4, we can teach them to logically account for other people's perspectives and teach them to understand what it truly means to think. Now I don't think many people would argue that Philosophy is useless (not talking about post degree job opportunities here) but I don't think many would argue it's just as important as core classes either.

So why do I believe it's just as important? Because how much time in our lives do we spend talking to people, hearing their ideas, and listening to their perspectives? The answer is a shit ton of time.

If people were educated on the logical formula of thinking (yes, there is one) imagine how much more cooperative we would be. Of course it would change life in general, but imagine how US (or general) politics would be if Philosophy was just as valued as core classes in k-12. Instead of constantly calling each other bigots, racist, libtards, etc the average dinner table political debate could actually be centered around why one opinion/idea would work better than other.

Here is a example of what happens when Philosophy isn't emphasized:

""I think all of those damn illegals need to get out of this country!""

""You're just a intolerant bigot!""

After Philosophy is emphasized:

""I think all of the illegal immigrants need to get out of this country""

""Why? What negative impact do they have?""

""Well they take our jobs""

""But all the evidence and research says they don't""

""But what makes them entitled to US citizenship?""

And back and forth. Instead of name calling, actual logical discussion.

If everyone was trained to take in account a persons life expirence which forms their perspective, be taught the logic that could be used when discussing ideas, and be taught the true nature and meaning of thinking, we would all get along much better, and more would get done.

This is not to say everyone should have the same opinion. That's not what Philosophy is. Take the example above for instance, the one arguing to deport the illegal immigrants is asking why they are inherently allowed to live here, which is a perfectly legitimate philosophical question/opinion. But there is a philosophical counter argument to that point that is just as legitimate. Even if I could wave a magic wand and this all come to fruition, people would disagree constantly. There is a logical formula to thinking but that doesn't mean only one specific result can come out of a certain thought and be logically and philosophically sound. Logic can't completely dictate Philosophy, it just can't. There is a clear, sound, logic to both the pro and anti immigrant persons argument, but mostly it's a moral position, which logic cannot always control. Another example: The discussion of what people think everyone is entitled or not entitled to is a intresting one. When someone says ""all people should have the right to live, so all people deserve healthcare free of charge"" there is a logic to that, but it is a largely moral opinion. The exact same could be true of the opposite opinion ""No one is entitled to anything on this earth, things are earned"". Both of those opinions can't be proven or disproven logically,(er well... At least in the context I'm talking about) but that doesn't make them invalid. Logic can't dictate everything.

So in conclusion: Schools should teach students the nature of thinking, the inherently logical aspect to thinking, and to respect different moral conclusions. Regarding the latter, most people would take that up to a point, many aren't going to sympathize or respect grossly authoritarian or discriminating opinions. Which nothing about philosophical logic and the nature of morality contradicts. I'm not trying to get rid of ""values"" people have at all. Differences of opinion are good, the inability to understand the logic and more often morality of why someone thinks what they do, is not good

EDIT 1: Ok so just saying ""Philosophy"" seems to have (somewhat) convoluted my point. I dont want 6th grader to have to take a year long class about the history of philosophy. I want a class that encourages largely philosophical type thinking, but it shouldn't be teaching everyone about certain Philosophy niches and the full understanding of certain things within Philosophy if that makes sense. Philosophical/logical type thinking with understanding towards different mortalities.. That's what I want the class to be basically. Would most likely have a different name than ""Philosophy"". It would just borrow somethings from Philosophy as we think of the course now.

EDIT 2: So I am a sophomore in high school who wrote the OP to bring up a interesting idea that I would never pretend is perfect. If this were to actually happen, so many kinks and things would need to be figured out and our culture would have to change pretty significantly in the US for this to ever be a reality. I think this has been a pretty cool discussion here and my perspective on this is different than when I first posted it because of the discussion. I did not post this to preach about how terrible everyone is, I posted just to see what people thought about this really. I do really believe that our society could improve with more emphasis on understanding other's perspectives and having a more logical, perhaps rational thinking process on ideas, and other people's ideas. When I said we need more logic, I meant in regards to discussing and perceiving ideas. I'm not saying everyone is illogical about everything because if that were the case there would be no Reddit for me to post on. Or a phone for me to type on. Clearly, we have our fair dose of logic all around. However logic regarding ideas is different than logic regarding most other things. Because with ideas, emotion and bias are thrown in. I would not want to live in a world with no emotion and it's something humans will have forever, well, unless robots or some shit. However, I think many people in the country are allowing their (usually) well intentioned pride and emotion to cloud their ability to have a productive discussion with people that think differently. I'm not going to pretend to not have allowed emotion and pride to cloud my judgement sometimes, of course it has. But I just feel, that if the way of thinking and analyzing ideas in Philosophy was more valued in our culture, we would be more united and productive. Of course we cannot get rid of emotion in our thinking, we never should. But we can become a society that is more critical thinking and productive when discussing ideas. There is no reason why we can't. Clearly I don't mean this will happen in a year, but there is no reason that we can't strive to eventually improve more and more when talking about ideas. As I said in the OP, many ideas are going to be rooted in morality. That's not because they're illogical, it's because that's how many ideas just are. Logic doesn't dictate all ideas. If I said that all humans have certain rights just because they're human dammit, there is no logic to that. But it's not illogical either. It's just a idea my morals lead me to. So often we think people's ideas are ridiculous and just attack them without thinking about why they might have that idea, which only serves to hurt both ways. Of course some ideas are predominantly based in logic, and at that point yeah, some ideas make more sense than others. But even then if you want to actually have a productive conversation with someone who has a different perspective on it, being a cunt isn't going to do anything. Not many people have had their mind expanded because they got called a name and mocked. I also imagine a society, where everyone could name a reason for their opinion. Not only do so many people not""question everything"", so many people question nothing. So many people have strong convictions about things but can't name any actual reason for it, and this doesn't just happen with socially akward adults on Reddit lol. If our education system put more emphasis on our ability to independently think and analyze things we would be better off. This is not to say we should scrap the education system and start from scratch, but we should make more of a effort to encourage critical thinking. Based on some responses on here, I can understand if you think my idea isn't actually a Philosophy class, but just borrows elements of Philosophy to encourage intellectual thinking. I also realize the class would have to be different than many Philosophy classes you can take at various levels of educatuon right now. And perhaps this wouldn't start until 6-7th grade once people are more mature. I still think we could find a way to encourage philosophical type thinking at the beginning grades, but clearly to a different degree than the higher ones."
"Why We're All Going to Die“Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”- John F. Kennedy

 

The only way out is through. Global society is dependent on artificially inflated energy resources—i.e. oil—that are directly leading us toward total collapse. Technology is being used to most efficiently maximize wealth of the largest corporate conglomerates at the expense of the social fabric and a living environment. The biosphere is in fact collapsing. The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"""The Symbol Grounding Problem"" (Floridi 2011) [x-post from /r/philosophyOfInfo]Luciano Floridi has offered a solution to the symbol grounding problem by identifying a condition that must be met in order to satisfy the SGP, called the ""Z-condition"", and claiming that no existing computational model satisfies the Z-condition.

What follows is a summary of chapter six of ""The Philosophy of Information"", but please note that the majority of this content is contained in the following self-contained PDF (so you don't need to read the book or really be familiar with the Philosophy of Information to join in this discussion):

http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2542/1/sgpcrfyr.pdf

Because this is of interest to the larger philosophy community, I am cross posting the entirety of the chapter summary (which is almost a word-for-word duplicate of the pdf), but again note that all of the necessary information is contained in the above PDF. Since this is cross-posted to multiple subreddits, I invite you to join us in the main discussion thread at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyOfInfo/comments/2v3oyl/chapter_6_discussion_thread_the_symbol_grounding/

SUMMARY

- Floridi wants to show ""what it means for data to be meaningful and for meaningful data to be truthful"", and that all 
- He introduces the ""Zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition), as the requirement that must be satisfied by a strategy in order to provide a valid solution of the SGP [symbol grounding problem, previously referred to in this book as the data grounding problem]"".

6.1 INTRODUCTION

- SGP - ""How can the data, constituting semantic information, acquire their meaning in the first place? ... The SGP concerns the possibility of specifying *precisely how* a formal symbol system can *autonomously* elaborate its own semantics for the symbols (data) that it manipulates and do so *from scratch*, by interacting with its environment and other formal symbol systems.""
- ""the difficulty is not (or at least, not just) merely grounding the symbols or data somehow successfully, as if all we were looking for were the implementation of some sort of internal look-up table ... the interpretation of the symbols (data) must be *intrinsic* to the symbol system itself, it cannot be *extrinsic,* that is, *parasitic* on the fact that the symbols (data) have meaning for, or are provided by, an interpreter."" (135) 
- He says ""all approaches seek to ground the symbols through the sensorimotor capacities of the artificial agents involved. The strategies differ in the methods used to elaborate the data obtained from the sensorimotor experiences, and in the role (if any) assigned to the elaboration of the data representations ... [but] none of the strategies can be said to offer a *valid* solution to the SGP. We shall see that this does not mean that they are theoretically flawed or uninteresting, nor that they cannot work, when technically implemented. The conclusion is rather that, conceptually, insofar as they seem successful, such strategies either fail to address the SGP or circumvent it, by implicitly presupposing its solution and begging the question."" (135)

6.2 THE SYMBOL GROUNDING PROBLEM

- The challenge posed by the SGP is:
	a) No form of innatism is allowed; no semantic resources can magically be presupposed as being pre-installed in the artificial agent (AA)
	b) No form of externalism is allowed; no semantic resources should be uploaded from the 'outside' by some *deus ex machina* already semantically proficient
	c) The AA may have its own capacities and resources to be able to ground its symbols.
- These three conditions are hereafter referred to as the Zero-semantic commitment condition (Z-condition).
- ""These three conditions only exclude the possibility that such resources may be semantic in the first place"" (137).

6.3 THE REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- This approach ""considers the conceptual and categorical representations, elaborated by an AA as the meanings of the symbols used by that AA. The problem is that ""the available representations---whether categorical or perceptual---succeed in grounding the symbols used by an AA only at the price of begging the question. We shall see that their elaboration, and hence availability, presuppose precisely those semantic capacities or resources that the approach is trying to show to be autonomously evolvable by an AA in the first place."" (138) 
- Harnad's (1990) hybrid model is examined first. If an AA using the hybrid model, which he calls 'Perc', uses say, neural networks to take in perceptual data and create conceptual categories such as 'quadruped animal', the conceptual categories could be considered the meanings of Perc's symbols. But Floridi notes that if the neural network uses supervised learning, it requires an external source of labeled training data and violates part (b) of the Z-condition. If the neural net is unsupervised, then the networks ""still need to have *built-in biases* and feature-detectors in order to reach the desired output. ... Moreover, unsupervised or self-organizing networks, once they have been trained, still need to have their output checked to see whether the obtained structures make any sense with respect to the input data space. This difficult process of validation is carried out externally by a supervisor [which is] entirely *extrinsic*."" **See note 1 in the discussion section below for my take on this.**
- What about an approach that constructs categories automatically given similarities between data? Floridi likens this to a move made by Berkeley in criticism of Locke, and says it still fails: ""how is the class of horses (the data space) put together in the first place, without any semantic capacity to elaborate the general idea ... of 'horse' to begin with? And how is a particular specimen of horse privileged over all the others as being the particular horse that could represent all the others, without presupposing some semantic capacities? And finally, how does one know that what makes that representation of a particular horse the representation of a universal horse is not, for example, the whiteness instead of the four-legged nature of the represented horse?""
- Another representationalist approach is that of Mayo (2003), whose *functional model* of AA shows that AAs can elaborate concepts ""in such a way as to be able to ground even abstract names."" Because data always underdetermine their structure, categories are interpreted as ""task-specific sets that collect representations according to their practical function. Symbols are formed in order to solve specific task-oriented problems in particular environments."" For example, ""an AA can generalize the meaning of the symbol 'victory' if, according to Mayo, 'victory' is not rigidly connected to a specific occurrence of a single event but derives its meaning from the representation of the intersection of all the occurrences of 'victory' in different task-specific sets of various events, such as 'victory' in chess, in tennis, [etc]"".
- Floridi claims that Mayo (2003) still fails the Z-condition because it relies on initial representations (Mayo's ""functional criteria"") which the AA already has access to---thus violating part (a) of the Z-condition.
- Sun (2000) proposes an intentional model which builds on a Heideggerian dichotomy of being-in-the-world and being-with-the-world. ""According to Sun, representations do not stand for the corresponding perceived objects, but rather for the uses that an AA can make of these objects as means to ends."" Sun has a first/bottom level of learning, and a second/top level of learning, with qualitatively different processing mechanisms and knowledge sets, which complement each other.
- But again, Floridi claims, the Z condition is breached already because Sun's approach has ""innate biases or built-in constraints and predispositions which also depend on the (ontogenetic and phylogenetic) history of agent world interaction"".
- Sun's model, called CLARION, employs Q-learning (which is based on reinforcement learning) **(See note 2)**. Floridi notes ""the algorithm works only if the (solution of the) problem can be modelled and executed in a finite time ... it is already clear that, by adopting the Q-learning algorithm, the intentional model is importing from the outside the very condition that allows CLARION to semanticize, since tasks, goals, success, [etc.] are all established by the programmer.""

6.4 THE SEMI-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Semi-representationalist approaches are also representationalist in nature, but deal with the AA's use of its representations by ""replying on principles imported from behaviour-based robotics.""
- Davidsson (1993) says that a description has three parts:
	1) designator - the name (symbol) used to refer to a category;
	2) epistemological representation - used to recognize instances of a category;
	3) inferential representation - a collection of all that is known about a category and its members and can be used to make predictions or infer non-perceptual information.
- Davidsson discusses two paradigms of machine learning: learning by observation (basically unsupervised learning, which Floridi says relies on a programmer to provide ""well-selected description entities""), and learning from examples (which Floridi says not only requires a trainer to select examples to learn from, but also ""presupposes a set of explicitly pre-classified (by the human teacher) examples of the categories to be acquired."" Thus Davidsson's strategy fails.
- Rosenstein and Cohen (1998) try to use a bottom-up process (perception -> symbolic thought), by using a ""method of delays"" allowing the AA to store perceptual data as-is (thus avoiding external semantic committments), a predictive semantics, and an unsupervised learning process which elaborates the semantics. It plots data on a cartesian coordinate system, thus constructing a ""cartesian representation"". But ""this 'Cartesian' semantic framework is entirely extraneous to the AA, either being presumed to be there (innatism) or, more realistically, having been superimposed by the programmer. ... the very interpretation of the data, provided by the actions, as information of such and such a kind of Cartesian coordinate system is, by itself, a crucial semantic step, based on extrinsic criteria.""

6.5 THE NON-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Non-representationalist approaches do not have symbolic representations (at least not in the localist, explicit sense), but for such approaches ""the SGP is merely postponed rather than avoided. ... [I]f it is to develop even an elementary protolanguage and some higher cognitive capacities, it will have to manipulate some symbols, but then the question of their semantic grounding presents itself anew."" **See note 3 below**.
- Floridi recalls the classic papers by Brooks (Brooks 1990,1991) on embodied/situated cognition.
- In his criticism of Billard and Dautenhahn (1999)'s DRAMA system, he notes that it has ""a reliance on neural networks, which incurs the same problems highlighted in section 6.3.1"". **(see note 4 below)**.

CONCLUSION

- ""(the semantic capacity to generate) representations cannot be presupposed without begging the question. Yet abandoning any reference to representations means accepting a dramatic limit to what an AA may be able to achieve semantically"". Instead Floridi introduces seven features that a valid solution to the SGP will need to combine:
1. a bottom-up, sensorimotor approach to the grounding problem;
2. a top-down feedback approach that allows the harmonization of top-level grounded symbols and bottom-level, sensorimotor interactions with the environment;
3. the availability of some sort of representational capacities in the AA;
4. the availability of some sort of categorical/abstracting capacities in the AA;
5. the availability of some sort of communication capacities among AAs in order to ground the symbols diachronically and avoid the Wittgensteinian problem of a 'private language';
6. an evolutionary approach in the development of 1-5;
7. the satisfaction of the Z condition in the development of 1-6."" (161)




DISCUSSION TOPICS

**Note 1** I've seen similar criticisms of solutions to the SGP before where the ""biases"" of some learning algorithm were taken to be signs of the programmer putting semantic information into the system and thus violating the SGP. But this is entirely too nit-picky in my opinion. *Of course* there are biases in any learning algorithm; real-life brains have biases that follow from their constructions: the minimum/maximum firing rate of human neurons, the biologically-determined connectivity between certain parts of the brain, etc. If I created a computer simulation to exactly model the human brain down to the neurobiological level, then nobody could reasonably accuse me of imparting semantic information into that simulation, would they?
And Floridi's statement that unsupervised networks need to have their output checked and therefore they violate the Z-condition is problematic---sparse autoencoders, for example, can learn representations given low-level data by performing their own checks, on their own generated representations. Yes, those checks are subjected to a mathematical error metric that is encoded by a human, but once the formula is encoded once it never has to be changed no matter how many representations are generated---more akin to the constraints set by the physical properties of the brain and neurons themselves!

**Note 2** Ron Sun's solution is classified as representationalist, and then closes the chapter with seven features which presumably he believes are not met with Sun's CLARION architecture. I am extremely familiar with Ron Sun's work; in fact I have published papers with him in the past, and I can tell you this: The majority of Floridi's criticisms in this chapter are based on a 10-year-old misunderstanding of what CLARION can and does do (which is 1-6, and likely 7). 

**Note 3** Does the symbol grounding problem still apply when dealing with representations that use symbols which are not declarative knowledge (knowledge *that*), but rather procedural knowledge (knowledge of *how*)? In the human brain, neurons can be said to have a symbolic state (either firing or not firing) *at a certain level of description*, but this level of description is not explicitly used by the human agent, rather the human behaves *in accordance with* behaviors whose state is set by the states of the neurons. This is quite different than behaving *because* some symbolic reasoning took place.

**Note 4** Now Floridi seems to be treating the use of neural networks as if he has performed a mathematical proof-style reduction to a previously solved problem: simply having a neural network now is sufficient to declare that the system violates the Z-condition? This case is not quite made (see my mention of sparse autoencoder networks). Am I missing something?"
"An argument against Galen Strawson's belief in a lack of free willSome background: I am a high-school freshman with little knowledge of philosophy (sadly there are no philosophy courses in my school district) so what I concluded may not be relevant or even a reasonable argument (I have no idea myself) with that said here is his argument against free will:

(1) You do what you do—in the circumstances in which you find yourself—because of the way you are. (2) So if you’re going to be ultimately responsible for what you do, you’re going to have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are—at least in certain mental respects. (3) But you can’t be ultimately responsible for the way you are (for the reasons just given). (4) So you can’t be ultimately responsible for what you do.

We have free will, the fact that accepting that we don't have free will makes you saddened, AND that ignoring this and saying we still do makes you saddened as well (by realizing that you are acting the way you are because it is the way you are actually strengthens the argument that you do not in fact have free will) we have to accept one of these thought processes (there is no gray area in free will, we either have it or not. There is no ""partial free will"", for that would not be free.) The fact that we choose one of these paths, both making us equally uncomfortable due to the fact that they end at the same result (of us having no free will) makes the choice irrelevant. So heres where free will comes in. If we were a robot we would be stuck in a stalemate, having no reason to pick either we would either:
1, pick neither and have the issue stay unresolved or
2, randomly pick one of the above as they both lead to the same path.
by following the second path we come to the conclusion that we have certain free will. What I mean by this is that if you were to have a ""memory eraser"" and put it over someone's head in a blank room and have them think on this and choose, record the choice, wipe their memory, and repeat again the person would still choose the same choice with quite a bit more frequency. This is evidence of a conscience, or personality not derived from their physical nature. Thus we can conclude that we, as human beings, have free will. Even if it is at a low level (making seemingly useless self debates come to a resolution) we still posses some level of free will and thus should be punished to some degree for the choices we make."
"Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution.Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution. **[This was written BEFORE the Occupy movement began]**


February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"How do you define if something or someone is human ??The question is clear..  

Do you think that a set of cells can be defined as human?  (i.e. 5 days old fetus (which is identical to frog fetus?)

Do you think appearance, intelligence  and motor skills can be defined as human ? (think of humanoid robots in 100 years and battle star galactica?)

Well, i am an engineer not a philosopher , but i thought only this subreddit may help me.

**Edit:** I recently understand you refer to ""human"" as ""homo sapiens"" in philosophy. I do not ask how do you define homo sapiens ..  So please , please do not refer to DNA any more 


**Edit2:** because of confusion let me ask differently :  what are the minimum requirements of something or someone that can be considered human thus should be respected and accounted noble as human ?

**Edit3:** Religions, biology, law all have some point of view in definiton of human.. I know those views and don't care because i think most of all have missing something. I am seeking a deeper answer so i am not in /r/biology .

"My friend and I exchange philosophical epistles to stay in touch.This one is ""On Evil""I’ve decided to write to you today, to discuss something that has been weighing quite heavily on my mind. I won’t pretend to be doing so with selfless motives; I enjoy this sort of talk, and I always jump at the chance to hone my writing abilities.

Since I have just spoken of “honing my writing abilities”, I will not allow myself an irresponsibly decorated introduction.

I am writing to you, dear friend, to discuss the Argument of Evil, and while I am well aware that you know the details of this argument, I will still summarize it in my own colloquial words. 

The world is full of murderers, rapists, liars, and villains of all sorts. Innocent children are murdered every year. People experience sorrow and pain of unfathomable intensity on a daily basis all throughout the world, and throughout the history of life itself. 
If someone COULD prevent such horror, especially at no cost to themselves, they would have the highest moral obligation to do so.  If someone cannot prevent these tragedies, then that person is not omnipotent.
If a god exists, then he is either impotent or evil.

This is the basic argument you will hear brought against the notion of god(or at least a benevolent god). My intention in this letter is not to defend the argument from evil, but rather to express my dissatisfaction with the best theological objections to it. 

It is so easy to allow emotion to commandeer ones faculties, and cause one to forsake clarity of thought, so I will try my best to avoid this perennial pitfall.

In my younger years, I never gave this argument much credit. I could dismiss it easily in a number of ways. As I aged, and I became exposed to the philosophies of academic Christians, my arsenal of responses to the problem of evil steadily increased. For the sake of convenience I will list the most common responses to the problem of evil below.

1.) Bad things happen to allow good things to come of them. I.E. ""When God closes one door he opens another"".

2.) God works in mysterious ways. (""We can't possibly understand why God does the things he does so let's just assume they are good"") This relates to the first argument but is slightly different.

3.) Bad things happen to remind us that we are sinful and must worship God. (""God made 9-11 happen to punish America for sinfulness"") A famous accusation of the late and not great Jerry Falwell.

- This next one is far and above the most sophisticated-

4.) God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

- The first argument can be discarded merely because of it’s blatant appeal to the future, and the third can be ignored because of its downright barbarism, as well as its inconsistency(Since it would require all non-Christian countries to suffer God’s wrath). 

The second and the fourth, however, have some value. 

The 2nd argument is obviously an appeal to ignorance, and yet I will give it a proper response because of it’s frequent use by noted apologists. I read an essay by the eminent Christian philosopher William Lane Craig on the problem of evil, and after suffering through his trademark wordiness, I saw that he was unable to avoid this appeal to ignorance.

He explain that as “finite, limited beings” we cannot possibly fathom the timeless, infinite God of the universe.

Forget, for a moment, how irritating this common religious response is, and look at it through the lense of your greatest ally; Reason. 

In general, the Christian responses to the argument from evil are always arguments of unavoidable victory. This means that they frame things in such a way so that if something good happens, it is God’s doing. However when something terrible happens, it is attributed to the mystery of God, or perhaps even the mischief of Old Nick. Victory is unavoidable.

This sort of thought reminds me of a passage from Voltaire’s Candide, which I will provide below.

“You see,” said Candide to Martin, “that crime is sometimes punished; that rascal of a Dutch captain met the fate he deserved.”
“Yes”, said Martin, “but was it necessary that the passengers on his ship should perish also? God punished that knave, the devil drowned the others”

Voltaire, with his merciless wit, rightly mocks this sort of childish thought. The idea that all good things are attributed to God, and all bad things find ownership elsewhere, is embarrassingly transparent and should not be given a second thought by the intellectually honest thinker.
 
We now move on to the most compelling rebuttal to the argument from evil, the 4th argument.

God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

I first heard this argument put forth by prominent Cambridge mathematician and apologist John Lennox. Lennox has been referred to as the “closest thing to a modern C.S. Lewis”, and is a rare example of a respected Christian Scientist( A Christian who is a scientist, not the outrageous hallucinations of Mary Baker Eddy). He used the 4th argument in a debate with Christopher Hitchens, and I felt as though his argument was not properly scrutinized. Here is the link to their debate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH68Y5MUGfo

The reason Lennox’s argument went uncontested is because Hitchen’s actually shares this belief. In Hitchens' book Letters to a Young Contrarian, he attacks the idea of universal accord, and states that disagreement is what makes life worth living. He explains how dull and meaningless a world would be where there is no contrary thought or competing ideas. Hitchens didn’t think to contest Lennox’s argument because he holds the same belief. This, I believe, caused him to miss the problem with Lennox’s idea.

If you haven’t seen the glaring contradiction in Lennox’s argument yet, I will not delay any longer in revealing it to you. 

Lennox claims that a world without any pain, or any disagreement, would be a robotic world in which love, peace, and happiness mean nothing. That without their opposites they have no definition. The problem is that the Christian doctrine idealizes this very type of world in the concept of heaven. Christians yearn for an Eternal Paradise where there is no sorrow or suffering. They “take no thought for the morrow” because Christ will undoubtedly return in their lifetimes. To Christians, this life is simply passing scenery on the path to paradise. The core Christian belief in heaven directly contradicts the 4th argument. 

I happen to agree that a Nirvana of this sort is as inconceivable as it is undesirable. A place where all people share the same opinions, and dissension is nowhere to be found, is not a place that I would want to exist in even if it were a possibility. It would be robotic, unconscious, and inhuman.

The problem for Christians is that the Bible does not agree with this sentiment, and so the 4th argument cannot be used by those Bible believing Christians who so love to use it.

The notion of heaven is the key to dismantling the 4th argument.

I am an agnostic who is quite friendly to the idea of Deism, and so I am not entirely convinced by the argument of evil. I look forward to hearing your thoughts dear friend, and I hope they will bring some clarity to this most difficult topic. 

Warmest regards to you and your family.

"Transhumanism - Your thoughts, emotions, fears, inhibitions? And how long will we remain human? What does it mean to BE human?Hello r/philosophy,

I'd like to take a few minutes to open a discussion regarding transhumanism, or the integration of cybernetics/technology with our own biology, and open up a venue for fellow lurkers to present viewpoints for and against it. I can't control anyone else, but I promise I'll respect your opinions as long as you respect my own.

One of the great minds on the forefront of such ideas is **Ray Kurzweil**, a futurist, author and inventor who has spent 30+ years studying a behavior coined ""*exponential growth*,"" in which technology and our understanding of it and our own biology does not statically grow from one stage to the next, but increases by exponential rates every year. Here are some thoughts of his:

>*""By 2029, we’ll have reverse engineered and modeled and simulated all the regions of the brain. And that will provide us the software/algorithmic methods to simulate you know, all of the human brains capabilities including our emotional intelligence. And computers at that time will be far more powerful than the human brain. And we’ll be able to create machines that really do have subtlety and suppleness of human intelligence. And they’ll combine that power with ways in which machines are already superior to us. They can impart us all of human knowledge with the few keystrokes, it can remember billions of things accurately. They can share knowledge in electronic speeds that are million times faster than the human language.""*

>*""...20 years, 25 years, these nanobots, these blood cell size devices will be going in our bodies keeping us healthy from inside. We’ll have some go inside our brains to the capillaries not invasively, there would be interacting with our biological neurons so it’ll extends our memory, our decision making faculties, put our brains on the internet and they also enable us to enter virtual reality environment from within the nervous system.""*

Another pioneer in the venture of Cybernetics is [Kevin Warwick](http://bigthink.com/ideas/39801), the first *human cyborg*. Professor Warwick, with artificial implants, was able to control a mechanical hand thousands of miles away by ""jacking his nervous system into the internet."" He has also done extensive research into biological-robotics, including a small robot with a ""brain."" Warwick is convinced that man must integrate with machine in order for us to survive and evolve as a species.

**Some other questions I have:**

* When will we have reached the point in which we are no longer *human*? If technology consist of tools created by humans to extend our own human abilities, how are these *not* human?

* For those of faith, do you believe it an *abomination* or an *act against God* to pursue the halting of biological death, or at least postponing it? Do you believe that we are meant to accept death as a part of life, and to attempt to stop that is, essentially, an affront against what we were ""meant"" to experience?

* When do you think AI will be created, if ever? Furthermore, what is your definition of AI? Some, like myself, would argue that we already have narrow, ""primitive"" AI within our everyday lives.

* Does the thought of SkyNet happening scare you?

* What are some possible ethical/moral laws and regulations that should be put into place as we move into the integration of cybernetics and human biology?

* I believe the most important question, though, is very simple: what does it mean to be *human*?

**TL;DR: SkyNet: Yay or nay?**

*I know that there are a lot of people that may not agree with the people/sources I've mentioned in this post, but that doesn't mean that we cannot discuss the possibilities for our coming future and the transition into technological mastery. I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of this.*

EDIT: I just realized there are already two or three threads dealing with technology and AI. I promise, I wasn't attempting to piggy-back off of these ideas."
"Humans and Artificial Intelligence Can't Form Real Friendships (Yet). Can humans and artificially intelligent robots form friendships? To explore this question, the term 'friendship’ must be defined. Many definitions of friendship are inspired by Greek philosopher Aristotle. He argues that friendships are characterized by the utility and pleasure that can be gained from a relationship, as well as the sharing of virtues and ideals. These criteria may seem to convey that friendships are motivated by self-interest. However, while the principles of utility and pleasure imply that friendships are founded on self-interest, the final principle of virtue sharing lies in the benefits they bestow on the participants. They aren’t necessarily mutually enriching. The final principle of virtue sharing conveys that friendships are different from other kinds of relationships because they require mutual benefit.

To examine if humans can form friendships with inanimate objects that emulate human life, two cases will be presented to establish a concrete example of how humans can form relationships with inanimate objects that resemble human life. The first case involves a man from Michigan who is married and claims to have a mistress, although neither of them are human. They are synthetic, robotic dolls. The man from Michigan promotes love with artificial beings and claims that they are happy together.

The second case involves a military bomb-disposal robot that was destroyed on a battlefield in Iraq. He was given a formal military funeral and was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star medallion. The soldiers working with the robot felt they owed him the respect of proper military recognition. The soldiers claim that the robot developed a personality of its own and he had saved their lives on many occasions.

These kinds of experiences are not exceedingly uncommon and illustrate the notion that humans can form powerful emotional attachments to non-living objects, especially if they resemble humans or human behavior. Even simple, non-living objects such as photographs of loved ones that have passed away can carry strong emotional sediment. Concerning robots, humans can certainly fulfill Aristotle’s criteria of utility and pleasure from machines, as their creation is meant to fulfill these very purposes. However, to determine whether a robot benefits from a relationship with a human, the desires of the robot should be examined. Robots don’t seem to possess any desires at all. They are machines devoid of free will. Therefore, in their current state, robots can’t fulfill Aristotle’s notion of virtue sharing and mutual benefit.

The developments of ‘artificial intelligence’ are meant to fulfill the theory of computer systems being able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. The question of if friendships can ever truly be formed between humans and robots is reliant on determining if robots can ever become truly alive, which suggests that robots would possess free will, their own desires, and autonomy. The criteria and classification of life according to leading modern secular thought are as follows: “All life is highly ordered and structured; all life reproduces itself; all life grows and develops to reach maturity; all life takes in and utilizes energy to carry out the functions of its components, which results in growth and development; all living things exhibit homeostasis; all living things respond to their environment by sensing external stimuli and changing their body to fulfill a behavior; and, finally, all living things adapt to external pressures, and evolve because of them.”

While this list of characteristics may be incomplete or contested by various demographics, such as religious groups or other such conflicting philosophies, it can be argued that artificial intelligence will soon be able to accomplish all of these characteristics, as programs such as viruses are already able to proliferate, reproduce, utilize energy, and so forth. In light of this prediction, robots should then be assessed as to whether they truly experience a desire to form a friendship with a human and recognize any mutual benefits. So long as artificial intelligence functions by a set of behaviors originated by their initial programming, it can be argued that robots can never satisfy this mutually satisfying condition because robots can never have truly autonomous free will. They wouldn't truly express desires, as they don’t have their own values or beliefs. In this sense, the characteristics of life in a robot could be thought of as deceptions that mislead us as to the true nature of the robot. In this sense, a higher form of life capable of forming friendships can be characterized by free will and autonomy, as well as the conventional characteristics of life.

In conclusion, so long as robots obey a set of behaviors as determined by computer programming rather than the innate mechanisms that bring forth free will and autonomy, this essay concludes that the developments of artificial intelligence is not currently sufficient for humans to develop ‘friendships’ with robots, according to Aristotle's definition of friendship. The driving force that compels humans to possess free will and autonomy currently seem to be incompatible with the driving forces of artificial intelligence that emulate life. The criterion of mutual benefaction isn’t fulfilled. The emotional attachments humans feel towards robots perhaps could instead be classified by other forms of relationships rather than ‘friendship’."
"Defeating the ""what about humans?"" argument for veganismMany people have effectively argued that we shouldn't eat meat from factory farms or other farms where animals are raised in bad conditions. For the purposes of this post I'll just assume this position.

But some go further and argue that it is wrong even to raise an animal for food in a good environment. Even if its life is good with positive well-being, it's still wrong to create such animals, therefore animal farming is always wrong. This doesn't make a lot of sense on its face: it's *good for* the animal, it has a *happy* life, how can it be wrong to kill it? But the vegans have a defense: imagine if they did this to humans. Would you support raising humans and then killing them for food? Of course not! It's barbaric! And so the vegan wins the argument.

There is one line of response to this which says that humans deserve rights which animals don't. Even though both animals and humans are moral patients, and both deserve not to suffer unnecessarily, humans (and whatever rare or hypothetical animals happen to have human-like levels of rational thinking, social standing, cognition, etc) also have special rights not to be raised and slaughtered. Thus, it's consistent to say that it's wrong to farm humans but not wrong to (humanely) farm animals.

That's one response, which I won't go into here. Agree or disagree with it at your leisure. Instead I will show how we can respond to the vegan argument while preserving a fully welfare-oriented perspective. And the first way to do that is to simply deny the assumption that farming humans would be wrong.

We can take it for granted that doing this in *reality* doesn't make sense: there would be too many social problems, it would be extremely economically inefficient, etc. Even if we allowed, say, consenting parents to produce and slaughter an infant, that would generate enough pure outrage and family tension to far outweigh the minor nutritional and gustatory benefits. 

However, let's imagine a world where people can be raised for food and it actually 'works'. E.g., suppose that aliens have watch over the Earth and they beam people away for euthanasia as they get older, something universal and predictable just like natural old age death. And suppose the aliens had planted humans on Earth just for this purpose. Is that better than Earth being an empty world? To me, it seems like it is better. I would rather live on such a world than have no life at all. 

Also, there is no need to restrict our focus to meat. Humans (and animals) could be raised and sacrificed for a wide number of things. For instance, it could be for organs - which I think we can commonly agree is no different from being raised and sacrificed for meat, except for the fact that organs are more important (they could save lives).

More interestingly, humans could be raised for sacrifice in other ways. Imagine that you are a Star Wars clone trooper who is tasked with guarding a robotic mining operation on another planet. Your job is for economic purposes rather than saving people's lives, you could be killed instantly by a surprise strike (suppose it is inevitable given enough time), but until then you have a decent life, almost no labor and enjoy just hanging around. Is it wrong that the mining company had you cloned, even as you are personally glad for it? I don't see this as the case. Of course, you might prefer an *even better* life (don't we all), but that doesn't change the basic fact that your life is better than nonexistence. Alternatively, rather than being raised for sacrifice, you could be raised for your labor (e.g. you are a cloned miner), still with a better life than nonexistence.

In logical terms, it sure seems like these things are morally equivalent to raising humans for meat, but they don't feel as wrong. How do we square these intuitions? Maybe raising humans for meat and labor are both wrong, or maybe they are both right. Either is possible, but this new perspective does make it easier to accept that raising humans for meat is right. It is no longer the stuff of absurdity, because the alternative is to take the mildly objectionable position that these mining operations are wrong.

But there is a way to draw a moral distinction between the two cases. Combat and mining and other pursuits befit the capacities of a human. Of course they are not perfect, they are not fully utilizing our human abilities. But for practical purposes, they come reasonably close. You need human intelligence and human dexterity to perform these tasks. On the other hand, raising a human for food does *not* befit human capacities. Our human strengths and abilities go unused as we are relegated to doing something that animals could do. Thus, being a soldier or a miner provides a kind of *objective* well-being that we lack when we are playing the role of livestock.

So we could say that farming humans is wrong. Does this condemn humane animal farming? No! Because if we want to be consistent, we must judge animal farming by whether it befits *their* capacities, not human ones. To be sure, even on a humane farm, animals are not completely fulfilling all their roles and making use of all their unique abilities. But that is true for the human soldiers and miners anyway. These humans utilize their capacities to a *decent degree*, and humanely raised livestock utilize their capacities to a *decent degree* (they eat, they grow, they run around, etc). When you combine this with perfectly adequate pleasure and little amount of pain, things are good overall. Things don't have to be perfect in order to be good.

In summary, there are two viable ways to provide a welfarist response to the vegan *reductio ad absurdum* against humane farming. The first is to outright deny that farming humans is, in principle, a bad thing. The second is to say that humans raised for food will necessarily have less *objective well being* than animals who are raised for food, because they are not being raised for the capacities befitting their species. When humans are economically raised purely for a purpose that does befit our species capacities (such as combat or mining), that is morally equivalent to humane animal farming, and both are better than nonexistence."
"Consciousness, cosmos, meI have written this in order to help me keep my ideas in order, but I thought I would share it in case someone shares my feelings. I suspect I don't meet any standards but my own and that anything of value has already been said.

**Introduction**


It is inherently apparent to a conscious being that there is more to reality than material mechanism, any account of reality which does not feature this is massively incomplete. I feel that this is only questioned because consciousness is a “supernatural” phenomena - it cannot be detected by our senses and even worse we all feel we have special private evidence of its existence, this understandably makes it an awkward subject for the scientific methodology. 


The picture of the world we have built has nothing resembling consciousness, there is no place for it, and this is not a minor discrepancy.


It is simple to demonstrate the problem: if you ask what is happening in the brain, you end up with the complete description of the neurological activity of the brain, but in the case of the brain you have to ask also what it is like to be that activity, so why, contrasted with every other system in the world, do you have to ask that question?


There is I think also a desire to explain away consciousness because it is the world of meaning, and we must not have a universe that is involved with meaning. Matter, which has responded so well to our inquiries and explains so many things, is implicitly taken as primary and so mind must be explained in terms of it, mind must come from matter in some way, it is an illusion that certain kinds of material things have. 


The western scientific project has been extraordinarily successful in explaining countless phenomena, and so consciousness has come to be viewed as one phenomena among many that were once equally as mysterious, bound to fall inevitably to the same methods, but consciousness is by its nature absolutely singular and cannot be regarded as such.


I believe that consciousness is key to our understanding the nature of reality, because it is the only thing about it that matters, without it nothing is of any significance whatsoever.


**An indication**

When considering the place of consciousness within reality, it is informative to ask what it is it can do that a “blind” physical body alone could not manage ie. what do you contribute?. I assert that there is no function that could not be achieved by unfeeling mechanism ie. you could take anything done with feeling and replicate it in a robot without, therefore consciousness does not exist because it is physically useful and such a “pragmatic” view of the reason for consciousness and more importantly of the operating principles of reality is invalid. I am not here because I am needed by my body, my body could cope on its own -  is my body here because I need it? simply put consciousness is not a necessary aspect of systems which do the things which animals do.


It could be said that consciousness is evidently biologically useful since we conscious creatures have conquered the planet, however, nothing that I do that is beneficial to the human organism is done consciously, I do not know how I think or move, I am not useful in this way. The organism does not need to indicate things to me with signals of feelings in order to get my input, since it is the organism that knows how to do the things it needs to do.
When I consider what my conscious experience consists of, it is clear that my experiencing is not of any particular use, it seems that it happens simply for the sake of my experiencing it.


It is vital to state definitively that there would be no way for a purely blind mechanistic system, as it is suggested the universe is, to develop and support consciousness, no matter if it was needed to win a survival race. The hierarchical view of reality with physics being the primary concern of nature and consciousness a product of this is shown up. There is more to reality than physics and its accidental by-products, a system with consciousness is a special kind of system.


Another important thing to consider is why it should have been that creatures with the very special property of consciousness emerged from the evolutionary process at all, I cannot help but believe in a teleological cosmos for reasons which I shall try to express in the next section.


**A tendency**


Consciousness is singular and is absolutely the most significant thing about reality, it stands out among all other things known about the universe.


We know that consciousness is possible, so it seems it would be a tremendous waste if reality didn’t use this potential, therefore I suspect that it deliberately moves towards creating it, I feel it cannot be an accident that the universe came to be such that it supports conscious experience.


**Free Will**


Free will is a central aspect of our experience of the world and yet I find it is impossible even to define what freedom could mean when looked at with familiar notions of systems, I assert that it is impossible from this viewpoint - however, we experience free will, could we if it were impossible? I assert that there is nothing to gain from our having an illusion of freedom, except from the flawed perspective which I have encountered occasionally, namely that consciousness is a series of tricks on us, designed for example to help us be social, the flaw is that there should be no self that needs to be tricked in this picture, only an organism that works with itself and does not worry about things like freedom and whether it is conscious.


In a purely physical universe there is no room for anything but bottom-up causation which propagates from the most primitive parts upwards, as addressed earlier I take it for granted that this picture is massively incomplete. If I am able to decide, then consciousness has the final say on what the stuff of the physical universe actually does, which is a good indicator that the physicalist hierarchy is invalid.


**A Conspiracy**


There is no way for components of a system like a brain to come together to achieve some holistic effect like consciousness, a unified experience emerging from separated brain ‘modules’ or neurons, this would require a conspiracy - reality working in favour of consciousness, which is not allowed in a universe that features minds as an afterthought. 

To view parts as a system requires a perspective of some sort. It is simple to demonstrate the problem here: imagine that the components of a brain are made to communicate via radio instead of their usual signalling mechanism, nothing should change, imagine then that they receive their signals from a computer recording of the brain’s previous activity - nothing changes from their perspective but from ours they are not forming a system at all and we would not allow for holistic properties.


The tying of the specific experience that is mine to a single brain is a peculiar thing, it means that when I die my brain could be digested by the earth and still be reassembled, resuming the experience that is me, this is problematic because there should then be no reason to distinguish between pieces of matter that were part of me and those that were not, I can conclude from this sort of experiment only that the existence of self at least introduces a complicating factor into the universe.


Finally, if some necessary condition for consciousness to appear in systems is found, it will not be sufficient, a reality which somehow grants consciousness to such systems is required.


I conclude that there must be a conspiracy in favour of consciousness which is not accounted for by physicalist accounts of reality, I think it is a solid assumption that the brain is something which taps into an already existent piece of reality.


**Cosmos**


This universe is not strictly physical, there is no question that experience is part of what is going on, but what is the significance of consciousness?
Some will not consider that life and the “fine-tuning” enabling its appearance is any indicator of a meaningful universe, they say there is some life here because there is bound to be some amongst an infinity of possible universes that exist, the extravagance of this explanation and its materialist bias is such that I lean towards a universe that has something to do with consciousness.


The earth is not the only planet and we are not the only species, it is important to some to stress that we are insignificant, especially given our size relative to even our own sun, but I cannot see that a conscious experience is a small thing, it does not have size as it is not a physical object, and we are each the center of an experience which seems complete.


The physical universe is something that exploded out from a single point, it is an expression, and conscious experiences are impressions of this, the universe being an expression means that it has something to express which it deliberately moves towards expressing.


**Conclusion**


My suspicion is that the question of what we are at our core is essential. Beyond our ideas about ourselves as humans and everything which goes with that I think we can say that we are the same identical thing, and anything that is conscious anywhere would be this same thing. This brings me to the hinduistic conclusion that we are the fundamental it having experiences, we are existence, we are as divine as things get.


The universe is something which blossoms deliberately into experiences, and I believe that this is the purpose of everything. To be experiencing and to be the universe is the most exciting thing imaginable, when I feel this way I feel alive."
"Asimov's Three LawsI was thinking about Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, which are as follows for those who don't know:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

I have ethical problems with the first and the third laws, and wanted to get Reddit's opinion/wisdom on the matter.

Concerning the first law, what if a situation arose where the robot had two choices, both of which involved harming humans? For instance let's take that old ethical problem (I may not have the details exactly right, but the principle is the same): There's a train, with no brakes, rolling down the tracks towards a large group of people. You're steering the train. You can either move the train to the side, killing a lone, innocent person, or not do anything and allow the train to kill multiple innocent people. What would the robot, following the Three Laws, do if it were steering the train? If he doesn't make a decision or decides not to change the train's course (effectively the same thing), he kills more people than if he takes action and steers the train (only killing one person). If you amended the law to say, ""if forced to react to a situation where the only choices, as well as inaction, caused harm to humans, kill as few as possible"", isn't that a utilitarian point of view? I personally agree with this, but many humans would disagree (they're the ones who would choose to let the train stay on its course). How do we decide what the robot is to do?

Concerning the third law, my problem is: why should we force robot to continue being in existence? If robots somehow developed the thought capacity to question their own existence, and choose not to continue living, then wouldn't forcing them to obey this law be cruel? Or would this law automatically force robots to desire to continue living as long as possible (their programming wouldn't allow them to have suicidal thoughts). If so is that unfair? What if they developed the capacity for pain - would the law still be just if they could feel pain? In questioning this law I also find that the second law is unjust if robots gained this level of consciousness (robots would effectively be forced into slavery). So i guess my question becomes: do the three laws limit the capacity of thought a robot could have? And is this fair?

Sorry this is a little stream of consciousness-ish. For those of you lazy bums:

TL;DR: When considering the first law, what should a robot do if forced into a situation that will harm humans no matter what choice is made (or isn't made). And do the second two laws limit the capacity of thought robots can have, and if so is it fair for humans to put a cap on the intelligence of other life forms?"
"""The Symbol Grounding Problem"" (Floridi 2011) [x-post from /r/philosophyOfInfo]Luciano Floridi has offered a solution to the symbol grounding problem by identifying a condition that must be met in order to satisfy the SGP, called the ""Z-condition"", and claiming that no existing computational model satisfies the Z-condition.

What follows is a summary of chapter six of ""The Philosophy of Information"", but please note that the majority of this content is contained in the following self-contained PDF (so you don't need to read the book or really be familiar with the Philosophy of Information to join in this discussion):

http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2542/1/sgpcrfyr.pdf

Because this is of interest to the larger philosophy community, I am cross posting the entirety of the chapter summary (which is almost a word-for-word duplicate of the pdf), but again note that all of the necessary information is contained in the above PDF. Since this is cross-posted to multiple subreddits, I invite you to join us in the main discussion thread at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyOfInfo/comments/2v3oyl/chapter_6_discussion_thread_the_symbol_grounding/

SUMMARY

- Floridi wants to show ""what it means for data to be meaningful and for meaningful data to be truthful"", and that all 
- He introduces the ""Zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition), as the requirement that must be satisfied by a strategy in order to provide a valid solution of the SGP [symbol grounding problem, previously referred to in this book as the data grounding problem]"".

6.1 INTRODUCTION

- SGP - ""How can the data, constituting semantic information, acquire their meaning in the first place? ... The SGP concerns the possibility of specifying *precisely how* a formal symbol system can *autonomously* elaborate its own semantics for the symbols (data) that it manipulates and do so *from scratch*, by interacting with its environment and other formal symbol systems.""
- ""the difficulty is not (or at least, not just) merely grounding the symbols or data somehow successfully, as if all we were looking for were the implementation of some sort of internal look-up table ... the interpretation of the symbols (data) must be *intrinsic* to the symbol system itself, it cannot be *extrinsic,* that is, *parasitic* on the fact that the symbols (data) have meaning for, or are provided by, an interpreter."" (135) 
- He says ""all approaches seek to ground the symbols through the sensorimotor capacities of the artificial agents involved. The strategies differ in the methods used to elaborate the data obtained from the sensorimotor experiences, and in the role (if any) assigned to the elaboration of the data representations ... [but] none of the strategies can be said to offer a *valid* solution to the SGP. We shall see that this does not mean that they are theoretically flawed or uninteresting, nor that they cannot work, when technically implemented. The conclusion is rather that, conceptually, insofar as they seem successful, such strategies either fail to address the SGP or circumvent it, by implicitly presupposing its solution and begging the question."" (135)

6.2 THE SYMBOL GROUNDING PROBLEM

- The challenge posed by the SGP is:
	a) No form of innatism is allowed; no semantic resources can magically be presupposed as being pre-installed in the artificial agent (AA)
	b) No form of externalism is allowed; no semantic resources should be uploaded from the 'outside' by some *deus ex machina* already semantically proficient
	c) The AA may have its own capacities and resources to be able to ground its symbols.
- These three conditions are hereafter referred to as the Zero-semantic commitment condition (Z-condition).
- ""These three conditions only exclude the possibility that such resources may be semantic in the first place"" (137).

6.3 THE REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- This approach ""considers the conceptual and categorical representations, elaborated by an AA as the meanings of the symbols used by that AA. The problem is that ""the available representations---whether categorical or perceptual---succeed in grounding the symbols used by an AA only at the price of begging the question. We shall see that their elaboration, and hence availability, presuppose precisely those semantic capacities or resources that the approach is trying to show to be autonomously evolvable by an AA in the first place."" (138) 
- Harnad's (1990) hybrid model is examined first. If an AA using the hybrid model, which he calls 'Perc', uses say, neural networks to take in perceptual data and create conceptual categories such as 'quadruped animal', the conceptual categories could be considered the meanings of Perc's symbols. But Floridi notes that if the neural network uses supervised learning, it requires an external source of labeled training data and violates part (b) of the Z-condition. If the neural net is unsupervised, then the networks ""still need to have *built-in biases* and feature-detectors in order to reach the desired output. ... Moreover, unsupervised or self-organizing networks, once they have been trained, still need to have their output checked to see whether the obtained structures make any sense with respect to the input data space. This difficult process of validation is carried out externally by a supervisor [which is] entirely *extrinsic*."" **See note 1 in the discussion section below for my take on this.**
- What about an approach that constructs categories automatically given similarities between data? Floridi likens this to a move made by Berkeley in criticism of Locke, and says it still fails: ""how is the class of horses (the data space) put together in the first place, without any semantic capacity to elaborate the general idea ... of 'horse' to begin with? And how is a particular specimen of horse privileged over all the others as being the particular horse that could represent all the others, without presupposing some semantic capacities? And finally, how does one know that what makes that representation of a particular horse the representation of a universal horse is not, for example, the whiteness instead of the four-legged nature of the represented horse?""
- Another representationalist approach is that of Mayo (2003), whose *functional model* of AA shows that AAs can elaborate concepts ""in such a way as to be able to ground even abstract names."" Because data always underdetermine their structure, categories are interpreted as ""task-specific sets that collect representations according to their practical function. Symbols are formed in order to solve specific task-oriented problems in particular environments."" For example, ""an AA can generalize the meaning of the symbol 'victory' if, according to Mayo, 'victory' is not rigidly connected to a specific occurrence of a single event but derives its meaning from the representation of the intersection of all the occurrences of 'victory' in different task-specific sets of various events, such as 'victory' in chess, in tennis, [etc]"".
- Floridi claims that Mayo (2003) still fails the Z-condition because it relies on initial representations (Mayo's ""functional criteria"") which the AA already has access to---thus violating part (a) of the Z-condition.
- Sun (2000) proposes an intentional model which builds on a Heideggerian dichotomy of being-in-the-world and being-with-the-world. ""According to Sun, representations do not stand for the corresponding perceived objects, but rather for the uses that an AA can make of these objects as means to ends."" Sun has a first/bottom level of learning, and a second/top level of learning, with qualitatively different processing mechanisms and knowledge sets, which complement each other.
- But again, Floridi claims, the Z condition is breached already because Sun's approach has ""innate biases or built-in constraints and predispositions which also depend on the (ontogenetic and phylogenetic) history of agent world interaction"".
- Sun's model, called CLARION, employs Q-learning (which is based on reinforcement learning) **(See note 2)**. Floridi notes ""the algorithm works only if the (solution of the) problem can be modelled and executed in a finite time ... it is already clear that, by adopting the Q-learning algorithm, the intentional model is importing from the outside the very condition that allows CLARION to semanticize, since tasks, goals, success, [etc.] are all established by the programmer.""

6.4 THE SEMI-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Semi-representationalist approaches are also representationalist in nature, but deal with the AA's use of its representations by ""replying on principles imported from behaviour-based robotics.""
- Davidsson (1993) says that a description has three parts:
	1) designator - the name (symbol) used to refer to a category;
	2) epistemological representation - used to recognize instances of a category;
	3) inferential representation - a collection of all that is known about a category and its members and can be used to make predictions or infer non-perceptual information.
- Davidsson discusses two paradigms of machine learning: learning by observation (basically unsupervised learning, which Floridi says relies on a programmer to provide ""well-selected description entities""), and learning from examples (which Floridi says not only requires a trainer to select examples to learn from, but also ""presupposes a set of explicitly pre-classified (by the human teacher) examples of the categories to be acquired."" Thus Davidsson's strategy fails.
- Rosenstein and Cohen (1998) try to use a bottom-up process (perception -> symbolic thought), by using a ""method of delays"" allowing the AA to store perceptual data as-is (thus avoiding external semantic committments), a predictive semantics, and an unsupervised learning process which elaborates the semantics. It plots data on a cartesian coordinate system, thus constructing a ""cartesian representation"". But ""this 'Cartesian' semantic framework is entirely extraneous to the AA, either being presumed to be there (innatism) or, more realistically, having been superimposed by the programmer. ... the very interpretation of the data, provided by the actions, as information of such and such a kind of Cartesian coordinate system is, by itself, a crucial semantic step, based on extrinsic criteria.""

6.5 THE NON-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Non-representationalist approaches do not have symbolic representations (at least not in the localist, explicit sense), but for such approaches ""the SGP is merely postponed rather than avoided. ... [I]f it is to develop even an elementary protolanguage and some higher cognitive capacities, it will have to manipulate some symbols, but then the question of their semantic grounding presents itself anew."" **See note 3 below**.
- Floridi recalls the classic papers by Brooks (Brooks 1990,1991) on embodied/situated cognition.
- In his criticism of Billard and Dautenhahn (1999)'s DRAMA system, he notes that it has ""a reliance on neural networks, which incurs the same problems highlighted in section 6.3.1"". **(see note 4 below)**.

CONCLUSION

- ""(the semantic capacity to generate) representations cannot be presupposed without begging the question. Yet abandoning any reference to representations means accepting a dramatic limit to what an AA may be able to achieve semantically"". Instead Floridi introduces seven features that a valid solution to the SGP will need to combine:
1. a bottom-up, sensorimotor approach to the grounding problem;
2. a top-down feedback approach that allows the harmonization of top-level grounded symbols and bottom-level, sensorimotor interactions with the environment;
3. the availability of some sort of representational capacities in the AA;
4. the availability of some sort of categorical/abstracting capacities in the AA;
5. the availability of some sort of communication capacities among AAs in order to ground the symbols diachronically and avoid the Wittgensteinian problem of a 'private language';
6. an evolutionary approach in the development of 1-5;
7. the satisfaction of the Z condition in the development of 1-6."" (161)




DISCUSSION TOPICS

**Note 1** I've seen similar criticisms of solutions to the SGP before where the ""biases"" of some learning algorithm were taken to be signs of the programmer putting semantic information into the system and thus violating the SGP. But this is entirely too nit-picky in my opinion. *Of course* there are biases in any learning algorithm; real-life brains have biases that follow from their constructions: the minimum/maximum firing rate of human neurons, the biologically-determined connectivity between certain parts of the brain, etc. If I created a computer simulation to exactly model the human brain down to the neurobiological level, then nobody could reasonably accuse me of imparting semantic information into that simulation, would they?
And Floridi's statement that unsupervised networks need to have their output checked and therefore they violate the Z-condition is problematic---sparse autoencoders, for example, can learn representations given low-level data by performing their own checks, on their own generated representations. Yes, those checks are subjected to a mathematical error metric that is encoded by a human, but once the formula is encoded once it never has to be changed no matter how many representations are generated---more akin to the constraints set by the physical properties of the brain and neurons themselves!

**Note 2** Ron Sun's solution is classified as representationalist, and then closes the chapter with seven features which presumably he believes are not met with Sun's CLARION architecture. I am extremely familiar with Ron Sun's work; in fact I have published papers with him in the past, and I can tell you this: The majority of Floridi's criticisms in this chapter are based on a 10-year-old misunderstanding of what CLARION can and does do (which is 1-6, and likely 7). 

**Note 3** Does the symbol grounding problem still apply when dealing with representations that use symbols which are not declarative knowledge (knowledge *that*), but rather procedural knowledge (knowledge of *how*)? In the human brain, neurons can be said to have a symbolic state (either firing or not firing) *at a certain level of description*, but this level of description is not explicitly used by the human agent, rather the human behaves *in accordance with* behaviors whose state is set by the states of the neurons. This is quite different than behaving *because* some symbolic reasoning took place.

**Note 4** Now Floridi seems to be treating the use of neural networks as if he has performed a mathematical proof-style reduction to a previously solved problem: simply having a neural network now is sufficient to declare that the system violates the Z-condition? This case is not quite made (see my mention of sparse autoencoder networks). Am I missing something?"

Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"The Mind/Body Problem and Type-Identity TheoryThis is a piece I wrote for my [blog](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/redletteralex) where I cover lots of different things about philosophy and stuff. I just wanted to present it here and get some responses from the community of /r/philosophy  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The mind-body problem is one of the classic problems of philosophy, the modern formulation of which belongs to René Descartes. Simply put, the problem is “how do physical neurological brain states relate to phenomenal mental states?” Descartes tried to solve the problem by saying that the mind and body are not the same and that they are both irreducible primitive substances that have the capacity to influence and cause things in each other. His solution rests on a condition for identity, that is, two things are identical if and only if they share all the same properties. As Descartes defined the mind as a non-extended thinking thing and defined body as an extended non-thinking thing, it follows from his criteria for identity that they cannot by identical for they do not share the same properties. Descartes solution to the problem has a lot of points of contention though. Firstly, how can an immaterial substance (mind) interact with a corporeal substance (body)? According to the Principle of Causal Closure (PCC) all physical effects are entirely exhausted by their physical causes which seems to leave no room for the mind to do any causal work. Moreover, how do we know for certain that the mind is a non-extended thing and how do we know that body is a non-thinking thing? His argument seems to commit the fallacy of the petitio pricinple, that is it begs the question by assuming that mind and body do not have the same properties. Descartes version of substance dualism has long been out of popularity in contemporary philosophy, but it is still widely discussed for its historical importance in setting up the modern day formulation of the mind/body problem.  

During the middle of the 20th century a new solution of the mind body problem arose from the like of philosophers such as U.T. Place and Herbert Feigl. Called the type-identity theory, it proposes that neurological brain states and mental states are not distinct and merely correlated, but they are in fact the same thing, that is, they are identical. An example commonly used is the mental state of being in pain. According to they type identity theory the mental state of being in pain is identical to the neurological state of c-fibers firing. In other words, being in pain just is c-fibers firing. This allows for a dissolution of the causal problem of substance dualism. Mental states have causal efficacy in virtue of being identical to physical brain states. It also allows for a simplification of theories of the mind/brain. Following Occam’s Razor, which states that the simplest explanation is most always the correct one, denying the existence of irreducible physical and mental “stuff” and instead positing only one substance simplifies our picture of the world into a less complex narrative. It is important to realize that this is an ontological thesis about the mind, not a linguistic thesis. Of course we use irreducible mental terms to describe our experience (i.e. “wants”, “desires”, knows”…) but the goal of the project is not to translate these utterances into sentences about synapses, electrons, quarks and the like. The point is that on an ontological level, mental states are identical to physical brain states, regardless of what on the surface our language about mental states and entities implies.  

The type-identity theory of the mind rests on the premise that mental types or kinds are realizable in a one to one correspondence with physical types or kinds. But are we really justified in making this assumption? According to some philosophers such as Hilary Putnam and David Lewis, a singular mental type or kind can be realized by many different physical types or kinds. The argument for this kinda of multiple realizability goes as follows: Say we encounter an alien species that, physiologically, is completely different than humans. Instead of having neural electrical signals for communication from the brain to the rest of the body, this alien species has empty sacs that fill with water or some other fluid. Now lets say we decide to poke at this alien with something sharp. Upon viewing its behavior; it moves away from the stimulus, makes an unpleasant sound, actively avoids the sharp object we poked it with, we would be justified in asserting that the alien is in a state of being in pain. However, since the alien has a vastly different physiology than us, it has no c-fibers to fire, it seems that the same mental type, being in a state of pain, is realized by a physical type that is distinct from c-fibers firing. Since the same mental state of being in pain can be realized by different physical states, it makes sense to say that that mental type is not identical to either physical type, for remember, things are identical if and only if they share all the same properties. If mental states are realizable by many distinct physical states, then it follows that mental states cannot be identical to physical states. This is a powerful objection to the type-identity theory of the mind and has been used to advocate a functionalist theory of mental states.  

Simply put, functionalist theories of the mind assert that mental states are not strictly identical to physical states, but instead can be described by the functional role they play in a larger system. So in our alien example, the mental state of being in pain can be reduced to the functional role it plays in the behavior of the alien, that is, its reaction the being poked with a sharp object. So the mental state of being in pain is described by the causal role it plays by causing other mental states such as the belief that one is in pan, the desire to relieve the pain, the behavior one exhibits when in pain, etc… Any internal state that mediates a similar pattern of causes and effects is pain—regardless of the specific physical mechanisms that mediate the pattern in any given case. Functionalism of the mind works well with comparative neuro-anatomy and physiology between humans and other species as it allows us to keep constant our usages of certain mental predicates such as “being in pain” or “desires” even though the underlying physical mechanism that ground such mental states are physically distinct. Not only is this a logically cohesive idea, it is also grounded in scientific methodology by allowing a sufficiently general schema to capture explanations which seems to be a necessary prescriptive condition for something to be considered a genuine science.  

Notice that functionalist theories of the mind are still physicalist theories of the mind. Physical brain states have ontological primacy in that mental states are dependent on them for their existence, but mental states cannot be fully reduced in a one to one correspondence with brain states. The relationship between the two can be said to be one of supervenience. A cursory definition of supervenience would be that there can be no difference in one without a difference in the other. For example, imagine a set of points in space time that are equidistant from each other so that the set has rotational symmetry. The symmetry of the set of points supervenes on the positions of the individual points; if we move one of the points, the set no longer has symmetry. The symmetry of the set supervenes on the relations between the points in the set such that if we change the position of the points, we no longer have a symmetrical across the set. Notice however that supervenience does not necessarily entail strong reduction. Semantic content of sentences does supervene on syntactical feature of the sentence, but they are not reducible to syntactical feature of the sentence. In much the same way, mental states can be said to supervene on brain states, but are not reducible to brain states.  

Functionalism is a popular position in contemporary philosophy of mind, but that does not mean it is without substantive objections. One possible objection is to deny that similar mental kinds are realized across species. Jaegwon Kim posits that mental kinds are distinct and we must differentiate between “pain-for-a-human” and “pain-for-the-alien”. His argument is an attempt to protect the identity-theory of the mind against multiple realizability arguments. Instead of rendering psychology an autonomous special science, multiple realizability implies that there is no structure-independent scientific psychology. There are only “local” scientific psychologies, each reducible to the theory of the underlying physical mechanisms of the structure-type in question. So the verdict on how successful functionalist theories of the mind are is still out and much great work has been done on the problem in question in the past 30 years. For more reading on the topic I’d recommend the SEP entries on type identity theories of the mind (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/) and multiple realizability (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/) as well as Hilary Putnam’s book Representation and Reality.

"Objection to a Premise in Dennett's Theory of MindIn his reply to Searle’s *The Myth of the Computer*, Daniel Dennett writes the following on categorizing objects exclusively on their “causal powers” (Dennett expresses similar ideas in his book *The Intentional Stance*):

>Surely we all agree that anything that has all the relevant causal powers of food—it saves one from starving, sustains growth and repair, tastes good, etc.—*is* food. And anything that has all the causal powers of oxygen is oxygen. We think that you could in principle give a body an artificial brain by giving it something that duplicated *all* the brain’s *control* powers. And any creature so equipped would “have a mind” in the only sense that makes any sense: it would have a well-functioning (prosthetic) brain.

http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1982/06/24/the-myth-of-the-computer-an-exchange/

I believe that the idea that “anything that has all the causal powers of oxygen is oxygen” does not hold if we replace “oxygen” with “a conscious mind.”   The reason for this is that there is more to the identity and categorization of minds then simply outputs and causal powers. 


Note:  In the above quote, Dennett uses the term “causal power” because it is the term that Searle used in his reply.  Dennett seems to prefer the term “control powers” and so I will use that in the thought experiment below.  In context it is meant as the actions of the brain & behaviors of people. 


To highlight the significance of considering qualia on the identity of minds, consider the following thought experiment.   Suppose sometime in the future that AI programs become so sophisticated that not only can they pass the Turing test, but we can map a given individual’s brain and replicate their actions so effectively that even people that know the individual cannot distinguish between the AI and the person.  Let’s assume that robotics is also sufficiently advanced to the point that we can construct a robot that is indistinguishable from the human body and that we can put a computer running these AI programs into robots and match all of the actions and behaviors of humans.  


Now let’s assume you have been in a happy marriage for many years and have many shared experiences with your spouse.  We take your spouse and map their brain and body and build a robot/cyborg replica that is able to match the control powers of their brain and physically are indistinguishable from your spouse.  The robot even would have the memories of your spouse in its memory.  This replica is so effective at producing the responses and reactions of your spouse that you are not able to distinguish between your spouse and the robot.  Even though their external outputs are the same, would you consider the robotic replica, which matches the actions and behaviors of your spouse, as equivalent to your spouse?  Would you consider your spouse and the robot as interchangeable?  If not, then there must be something besides control powers of the brain that is significant to the identity and categorization of minds.   I posit that what is important to the identity to conscious beings is the internal subjective experience (i.e. qualia) had by the conscious individual.  For example, if your spouse died and the robot replica took their place, the fact that the entity that has the subjective experience that you identify as your spouse was not actually sharing the experiences with you would make all the difference to you.   


We could also take the thought experiment a step further and consider the case in which you yourself are mapped and replicated with a robot with an AI brain. Its causal powers would be interchangeable with your own to the point where the rest of the world could not tell you from your robotic replica.  Would you experience the same qualia or subjective experience as the replica?  If you had a conversation with your replica, would you see it through both pairs of eyes?  If not, then we can conclude that it is not you.


At this point an objection may be raised that even though we cannot identify a given individual solely by the control powers of the brain, we can identify properties or categories of objects based on behaviors or control/causal powers.  Therefore, we can also identify consciousness as a general property of objects or entities based on behaviors.   To illustrate, we can carry this argument over to non-conscious objects.  For example, let’ say we define a kitchen knife as an object that has a sharpened metal blade, a handle, and can effectively cut food.  Now we may not be able to replace my particular kitchen knife by building a replica, but we can easily produce an object that is a kitchen knife (i.e. has the property of being a kitchen knife and belongs in the category of kitchen knives) and matches all the causal powers of some particular kitchen knife (even though the specific identities of each are different).  


However, a fundamental characteristic of conscious beings is that we consider their internal perspective and experience and not merely what they do or are capable of doing.  It is important for to us to know what is going on in the minds of others regardless of how they behave.   We learn from an early age that people’s behaviors and their internal thoughts are in two distinct categories.  In adult relationships, the internal experience of others is just as important to us as how they behave.  In short, behaviors are consequences or outputs of conscious beings, but it is not consciousness itself.  Defining consciousness based on behaviors (i.e. the control powers of the brain) alone is not correct.  It is reasonable to assume that over time we will get better and better at replicating the outputs and behaviors of humans with AI.  But even if we get to the point where we are able to match the behavior of humans perfectly, this doesn’t necessarily mean we have produced internal subjective experience or qualia.

"The Possibility of Knowing Thyself: Impressions, Triangulation and why Theories aren't Subjective**Thesis** Part of the reason philosophy exist. Part of the reason philosophy developed naturally. Part of the reason philosophy continues to persist is that it answers some questions that are otherwise unanswerable. These questions take over the limits of science and art, yet we wish to talk about them. And beyond science and art, we can only talk about these subjects in a philosophical manner.

""Philosophical manner"" meaning that philosophical answers aim to answer questions about objectivity and subjectivity without trivializing either one.

One of the question is not so much a direct question but a commandment from one of western philosophy's founding member: Socrates. Socrates directed his followers to know thyself indirectly by the famous dictum: The Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living.

That is, the life you live and are living right now is not worth anything unless you examine it. Like gold in itself is worthless unless you know what properties it has. And you can only know the properties of gold by examining it.

In this post I aim to talk about the framework all humans find themselves in in this endeavor as we seek to find ourselves and make our lives worth living and how we can discover the properties that enrich our lives.
_____________________________________
**Part {1}**

You're an idea. 

Or rather an idea is essential to your being.

Try to exist without having an idea on your mind. This may arguably be possible, for example, through sleep or meditation. But other than in special circumstances, wherever you go you go with an idea on your mind.

The only way to start off defining yourself is going through the idea barrier. Without an idea you cannot exist. To prove you exist, you need an idea first.  

___________________________________

**Part {2}**

To be something is to be that. 

So whatever you are is a reference to what you are. But to make a reference to what you are you have to be something that is referenced or capable of being referenced. 

To reference means to point to something. When you're referencing yourself you're pointing at yourself.

You cannot, however, just point to yourself and find yourself. It's like saying ""A is A"". An ""A"" is worthless without knowing its properties, its relations to other letters, or how it can benefit/enrich you from using it. 

If you point at something that is you, you have to be both the subject and the object in question.

You have to be (1) something that is subjectively evaluating an objective thing and you have to be (2) an objective thing that is being referenced.

___________________________________
**Part {3}**

When we reference an apple, we first get an apple and call it an apple. Then we compare an apple to what an apple is not.

If the apple is red, then we say that the apple is red. But the apple is red because it's not any other color.

The positive and negative qualities are intimately tied. Just because the apple is not blue doesn't mean it's yellow. The apple is both red and not blue. It's not just not (any color but red). The apple is red and not (any color but red).

Why an apple is red can be explained or reasoned in many different ways:

1. We can talk about lights waves 
2. apple genetics 
3. the climate that allowed for red apples to emerge 
4. the environment that favored red apples to continue existing vs different color apples that may have gone extinct or never given a chance to flourish 
5. our vocabulary that says ""red means this particular phenomena"" and an apple that adheres to that definition (""An apple is red because red it word we use to describe the phenomena that the apple is exhibiting"")
6. Etc

Some of these truths are absolutely true no matter the context. Light waves and apple genetics may be true for everyone and everything; regardless if they can understand the concept or not. 

When it comes to vocabulary, we may transfer truths to one another using words but only if those words are grounded in truth AND we agree on the meaning of the words.

We could have a debate that seems contradictory. One side may argue that the apple is red and another that it's blue. And they may both be right if their use of the word correspond to the same phenomena. 

The important or relevant thing to take away from this is that:

1. our portal towards truth depends on our impression of the world.
2. our impression must be neutralized to reach objectivity. 
3. our impression of the world and absolute truth are indistinguishable/inseparable (our impression of everything and anything is founded/reasoned through truths that exist independent of our impressions and that in itself is a truth)
4. our impression of the world is a mixture of truth and subjectivity

We can remove our personal subjectivity in order to concentrate truth (science) or we can indulge in our subjectivity (art). This isn't relevant but your day to day life is probably a somewhat balance between the two.

_______________________________________________
**Part {4}**

To know thyself is to concentrate the truth of your subjectivity. 

Let's say you're colorblind so that an apple I call red you see as forest green. You would live with subjective truths that are based on impressions that may include:

1. It's difficult for you to distinguish between forest green plates and red apple slices laying on top of the plate
2. There are colors that other people can see that you can't
3. There's something in your body that affects the impression you have of the world that results in not seeing things other people see
4. You don't know and can't know the impression non-colorblind people have of red apples

Everything I said in the first half of **Part {3}** can be known by the colorblind person and everything I listed here can be known by the non-colorblind person.

That's because the lists are ideas commenting on truths. They are ideas that beg the question with goal of justifying them. They are ideas that presuppose a foundation for reality. But the ultimate justification is your impression. Not the actual absolute truth that exist independent of you; since its only value is your dependence of it. And your dependence of it is based on impressions.

That's why any scientific question can lead to an ad infinitum ""why"" until it's stopped by ""well that's how far science has gotten us thus far"" or ""well, that's a different field of study."" Although science is humanity's best hope to cure diseases, stabilize inequality, end suffering, and create technological advancement. This isn't criticism or lampooning science. Since each discipline/gaze/etc is limited in scope and science is no exception.

Ideas that comment on truths are called theories or hypothesis. But not all ideas comment on truths. And not all truths need to be unearthed or discovered. Some truths are self-evident. For example, our impression is self-evident and true. And yet our impression of the world begs the question because it's an idea that instinctively and instantly comments on further truth that are not self-evident. 

We can then contribute to the impression of the world through art. Or we can deduce our impression of the world through science.

Necessarily, art carries with it scientific truths that can be uncovered and at the same time scientific truths affect our perspective of our art and artistic unfolding. So even the illusion of removing subjectivity is merely an illusion.

________________________________
**Part {5}**

I'm not a dualist. I favor a threesome perspective. That is founded on triangulation.

To know yourself you first have to find yourself. And as with any mathematical problem or navigation, you need at least two knowns or two coordinates to find yourself. 

I would argue that to find and know thyself you need absolutely need two broad coordinates: Absolute Truth and you. 

The difference between the two is that while you're founded on absolute truth, absolute truth is impermeable. You're not impermeable. You're tainted by subjectivity. You are a changing thing based on the changing universe. It's true that sometimes you're cold and sometimes you're hot. Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad. You regard some things as morally good and other things as morally bad. And what those things are sometimes change and sometimes they don't. But all of it is based on absolute truth. 

Change is part of absolute truth. Everything changes constantly. Any impression of the physical world being stagnant or stationary is an illusion based on impressions. Based on truth and subjectivity. 

It's like a video game that changes maps. The buttons you press are always the same to achieve the desired results.

There may be games that change the button layout each map so that you have to re-adjust, but there is still a foundation of truth that guides the change. There's still an objective. You cannot play a game without there being an objective. Regardless if the objective is created by the game creators or yourself. To move, to think, to do requires a plane where you can triangulate yourself. Whether that's space and time or morality or a video game.

Ultimately, to know thyself is to be aware of how you define what you define. Because the part of you that is based on absolute truth is unchanging and consistent. But it's not physical. It's based on principles that transcend the physical since its properties are evident but inconsistent with how the physical behaves.

______________________________________
**Counterarguments**

On whether **Part {1}** is just Cartesian skepticism: I'm not saying that the physical world can be trivialized or that your ideas take precedence to the physical world. I'm saying that as soon as you start talking, you're bringing an idea to life. You cannot talk or think or exist without bringing an idea to life. Even if you exist without thought there's no way to know you exist because to know you exist is a thought. 

The idea itself can be like a plant that sprouts. We can investigate the origins of the plant and its makeup or we can analyze the plant itself. But you cannot start to talk without there being an idea associated. Your words and thoughts are part of the nutrients that give the plant life, among other things.

One may argue ""what if we program a robot to say 'I exist' or 'I am'"".

I think this goes back to the fundamental question of how can you know thyself.

Doing one of those fancy European philosophy moves we can see it another way. The euro step? No that's basketball. I mean the flipping something on it's head in a very French way.

Asking ""what happens if a robot says 'I exist'"" is the same thing as saying what happens when a rock says ""I exist"" or if another human says ""I exist.""

We can only know they exist insofar as we can see they exist (either artistically or scientifically). The same thing when you yourself say ""I exist."" You exist insofar as you can see yourself.

You see yourself when you express yourself. Sometimes you express yourself and only you can see the expression. Or sometimes you express yourself but only you have the perspective you have (since each person has their own perspective). Either way, you can simultaneously express yourself and see yourself since your perspective is a further expression of you. 

Although usually we express ourselves first and after a while reflect on ourselves. 

In short, we can deduce an existential being exist or not (and in what ways it exists) based on pragmatism. And that pragmatism can be led by science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two. 

Concerning ""science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two,"" we naturally combine both. Furthermore, we can't influence one part without influencing the other. But this unfolding also feeds into who you are and what you can reflect on.

It's bad philosophy to introduce a concept at the end (such as pragmatism) but moving on, your being observes the universe. Your being is indirectly observing absolute truth. And our subjectivity shines a light on different truths that depend on our subjectivity.

We can put our subjectivity aside by cancelling it out in theory and militarize pragmatism in a scientific context and discover ""objective truths"" but even without doing this, your subjectivity runs into objective truths all the time. It's just that our subjectivity measures truth less accurately than science. Although to an equally true degree. 

The only way to measure truth more accurately is through pragmatic effort, then. To DO something first and see what results. Evaluate what you see. Whether it's something artistic or scientific or if it's evaluation artistically or scientifically. To do something, anything, and then to triangulate that something with absolute truth to find yourself. Yourself being a union of the two and thus a triangulation of who you are. If we are to equate who you are with where you are. But finding where you are is the first step of finding thyself.

"Free will. I’ve come to the conclusion that none of us truly have free will. What we instead have is the illusion of free will. 

Think about it. Every thought and action we have is determined by 1. the information sent to the brain that’s then processed and 2. Chemicals that that alter the way we process and respond to that information. 

It is due to this simple input:output response we have that I liken us to fleshy robots. Every action we take, every thought we think is a direct result of what’s being inputted into our bodies/minds. The outputs generated (thoughts/actions) are predetermined due to our past experiences and to the physical particles around us and in us (all of which in turn were resulted from to the same principles.) 

The fact that we have a sense of self is what I think gives us a feeling of control. We can understand that cognition is taking place and we feel as if we have a say in the outcome however this is just an illusion, for those thoughts, once again, are only the direct result of historically predetermined external and internal stimuli. 

This leads me to the hypothesis that since everything is essentially a compounding sequence of predetermined results the entire future of everything that is and was, was instantaneously determined the moment the big bang happened. "
"The long future and the ultimate fate of humanityPlease consider this idea. It is not a statement of what absolutely will happen, but what I think is the most positive outcome for humanity. This might sound absurd at first but please follow the logic.

When we view the future of robotics, we usually see the robots as either our masters or our slaves. I don't think either of these will be the case in the long future. As we decode the brain, we will be able to construct a machine that operates on the same principles. Unlimited by evolution, we will eventually be able to create sentient beings far more advanced than us. This is a moderately common belief. It's place relative to us is the interesting part: it will not be our equal and thus not ""replace"" us. Consider an analogy between what created us, and what we will create. We were created by evolution from the planet. Our role is not to replace the planet, we have simply inherited responsibility for it. Likewise, the beings we create will not replace us, merely accept responsibility for us.

Humans are delicate, physically and mentally. We are horribly suited to exploring the universe. We are horribly suited to living outside of a narrow physical and emotional spectrum. Cities and money and such have plunged us into a lot of turmoil that we simply don't have the wherewithal to save ourselves from. Perhaps the root of the problem with us is this: we have to constantly start over. Because of our limited lifetimes, only a small amount can be achieved before we die. And the next generation has to relearn and then *advance* us, if we hope to survive. And as the sum total of our knowledge and advancements builds, the mountain each generation must climb grows. We have temporarily overcome this problem by specializing, but the more we specialize the more fractured our knowledge becomes. To unify different areas of knowledge is an immense task that will become increasingly difficult as we progress.

These new artificial life forms would overcome all the problems we now face. And, they would have the tools to solve new ones we can't even imagine yet. Unbound by intricate and delicate biological machinery, they could reform themselves endlessly. They would be virtually immortal, and so they would have time to advance and progress well beyond anything we could achieve.

Creating these beings, I believe, is the ultimate fate of humanity. We fight against our flaws so hard, but it's a losing battle. We are not designed for deep space exploration. We are not designed to discern truth. We are not designed to work ourselves crazy. We are not designed to live among a million strangers. We are designed to have some friends and lovers, enjoy food, protect what is ""ours"", etc... That's it. And I believe that these new beings will not be our rulers, but simply our caretakers. No one person on earth can even close to fathom the ""system"" as a whole. The social, cultural, economic, political, psychological system. Every person is only seeing a crude version of one tiny part of it. 

Many futurists place humanity at the center of the future, but I just don't think that's the case. We're simply used to seeing humans as the baddest dudes on the block. To our own detriment. At some point in the future it will be time to step aside.

To achieve this, we should massively re-appropriate our efforts into Neuroscience. Computer science is well on it's way thanks to consumer culture. We are lucky for that. Once we decode neuroscience, we can truly integrate CS and neuroscience to pave way for this advancement. No domain of knowledge is more important right now than neuroscience. Solving neuroscience will indirectly solve all other problems."
"Anthropic reasoning questionConsider a drone that is being shot at with a missile. It appears reasonable to write drone software so that in the event of survival it would decrease it's estimate of missile's effectiveness, in the precisely same well understood manner as if the missile would say ""bang, you're dead"" instead of destroying the drone. It doesn't matter that the on-board computer would not exist if it had been destroyed and wouldn't conclude anything. Simply not a part of calculation. 

Now, this is pretty similar to John Leslie's Firing Squad analogy, except instead of the human I have a drone which I can program arbitrarily. I effectively argue that in Leslie's Firing Squad, the evidence is to be processed in same manner as if the nerf guns were used.

I'm arguing with some amateur philosopher who seems convinced that this reasoning is ""crazy"" for a human observer (even though he does not believe in soul or the like). I'm myself an applied mathematician and this one is a fairly straightforward problem for design of any sort of robotic drone (Matter of fact I have written game AIs, and everyone routinely assumes that if the program is still running this is evidence that the user has not deliberately exited it). The probabilistic calculations in question are quite straightforward, and are utterly commonplace in all sorts of hardware self-test scenarios. My understanding is that anthropic bias is a much subtler issue arising in different types of probabilistic equations. 

I vaguely recall a variety of anthropic principle that coincides with the reasoning of the drone in my example (and I know philosophers tend to very thoroughly consider such cases), but the name of that variation evades me. Can someone help me with that?"
"On the reality of genuine pain?I'm a software developer by trade and sometimes crappy philosoher on the side.  One of the main topics *everyone* beats to death on both sides is ""Artificial intelligence"" and the Turing Test - can we make a computer simulation that can pass as human when engaged in conversation?
  
I propose a similar experiment based on pain.  We all know what pain is because it HURTS.  Yet ""Pain"" is very much an emergent phenomenon.  Break apart the brain looking for it and you might find some neurons are more excited than others but that's it - you won't find ""pain"".
  
So what if I write a computer program where an object holds a ""current_pleasure"" quotient that ranges from -10 (mortal pain) to 10 (orgasm).  If I stop the program in a debugger and analyze it and see that its current value is ""-4"" do I conclude that it is in pain?  And more importantly - do I empathize with it?  Is it immoral to purposefully give the program more pain?
  
What if I go a little further and build a robot with a dial on it.  I program the robot so that the more you turn the dial towards ""pain"" the more it will writhe and scream.  Is it immoral for me to adjust the dial towards ""more pain""?  The intuitive answer is ""no, it's just a machine"" but that just sets up the question as to what exactly is different between that robot and another human? 
  
At what point would a robot's ""pain"" become real enough that it would become unethical to keep ""hurting"" it?  Where exactly is the reality of pain?"
"Here's why debates about free will have more to do with semantics than logic...The endless debates on free will among intelligent people are troubled mostly by a lack of any agreement on what free will actually means. It seems to be more about semantics than anything else.

When people talk of individual freedom, many things come to mind. Of primary importance is the question of whether you are free to do what you want to do. 

Someone locked in a room tied in a straight jacket is clearly less free than you are at this moment. You are more free because you have more options. 

In a broader sense, we can say that a free society is more valuable than  an oppressed society precisely because one is more able to do as they wish. Few would argue that this freedom is worth having.

But is this truly what it means to be free?

**Options**

In a recent discussion on free will, Dan Dennett, one of the world's most renown philosophers of consciousness, proposed the following scenario: 

Imagine a chess program that contains a flaw that limits the movement of its queen to only one square at a time. (1)

This limitation would considerably decrease its chances of winning against a program of comparable strength without this flaw. In fact, if given the opportunity to gamble on a series of games, you'd be crazy not to put all your money on the program without the flaw.

Yet look at what's really the difference here. One program has more ""freedom"" of moves than the other solely on the basis that its queen is not constrained. But is this kind of freedom really what we think of when we talk of free will? 

Hardly. We know each program is fully tied to its data. Every move is merely a calculation predetermined by its programming. If you could understand its code, you could predict its move in every sense. 

Thus by any genuine sense of the word, no one would attribute freedom to this program, despite one being described as more free than the other. 

Isn't what's really important far more significant than just having more options?

**Control**

Perhaps we should define genuine freedom as having some sense of control. When we are free, we are able to influence the behavior of things or the course of events. This would seem a sensible way to differentiate between the type of freedom you and I have versus that of a chess playing computer.

Yet this also has issues related to semantics. As Dennett explains, if a pilot gives up control of the plane to an auto pilot program, then the program designed to run that auto pilot is, by all definitions, controlling the plane in that moment. 

This is true, made evident by the fact that the pilot could be sleeping while the auto pilot navigates the plane, a situation where the pilot is clearly not in control of the plane.

Yet is an auto pilot program ""free"" in any useful sense of the word? Isn't it just as tied to the data as the chess playing program? 

It seems control isn't enough either. We need something better than control to convey the type of freedom we have. But if having options and control is not enough to illustrate genuine freedom, then what is?

**Desire**

Perhpas the missing ingredient that demonstrates genuine freedom is the ability to act on one's desires. 

This would surely differentiate the type of control we have over that of an autopilot. For as much as it is in control of the plane, it is not doing this because it wants to, it does so because its programmed to fly. It has no desires. 

So we can say that the freedom we attribute to ourselves that genuinely differentiates us from a computer program is not simply having more options, or having the ability to do as we wish, its the ability to have those wishes in the first place. 

Options, control, and desire. No sensible human would suggest we don't have all three. So why isn't this case closed?

**Genuine Freedom**

The reason is that for many, its not enough to simply say we can act on our desires. That's top level stuff. What's really important is the root of those desires. Our thoughts. 

Famed German Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer noted this issue almost two centuries ago when he said, *""Man can do what he wants but he cannot want what he wants.""* (2)

Isn't genuine freedom of will best defined as the ability to consciously originate and control our own thoughts and desires? Consider what it would mean to not have this ability. 

Suppose every thought you had all day was merely placed into your mind by your neighbor. Though you would be aware of the thoughts entering your consciousness and could follow along with the process of deliberation, you would have no control over any thought. 

In such a scenario, you'd be at the behest of your neighbors desires. In what possible way would anyone describe this situation as being free? Thus consciously initiating our thoughts is genuine freedom.

**Initiating Thoughts**

Luckily, though we're susceptible to influence, no other person is in control of our thoughts. But are we consciously initiating our own thoughts?

It sure seems so that way. Yet there's no logical manner to demonstrate the ability to consciously initiate a thought because for that to be possible, you'd have to think a thought before you thought it. 

There is no logical way to consciously author our own thoughts because each thought either pops into our consciousness for reasons we're not aware of, or they each require a thought of their own. 

Though it may feel like we are consciously originating our thoughts, the idea is nonsensical.

**The Endless Loop**

And thus we end up with two distinct ideas of free will that keep the world's top thinkers endlessly debating. It ultimately comes down to what you value.

If the ability to make choices and to follow your own desires is how you define free will, then surely have it. 

But if you value the notion of consciously originating your thoughts, actions, and desires, there is no logical manner in which free will is possible. You cannot think a thought before you think it.

It's a game of semantics. How you define free will is really what determines your position. There is nothing wrong with either view, you merely must choose what elements you value most.

The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

[iv] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"How do we make a case FOR logic?This is something that genuinely has me stumped, and please let me know if this comes under 'idle musings' and I'll cast it into the fires of Mount Doom.

But when I'm arguing with someone over something that may have even a *possible* chance of an unpleasant or depressing answer, I am often posed the question ""Well why should I be logical? You're just being a heartless robot! You can **feel** things, you don't need logic to know everything! In fact, your devotion to logic is because you are *brainwashed* by logic, you're a *logic bigot*!""

Now, to me, being a logic bigot and all, this is a steaming pile of horse shit.

But how on Earth do I persuade someone that does not 'believe in logic' that logic is the preferable tool of understanding? How can I even make that argument to them if my argument is based on logic, and they feel logic is just some passing ideology for mathematicians?

The concerning thing is, I'm not entirely sure I can logically or otherwise justify my adherence to logic."
"The Mind/Body Problem and Type-Identity TheoryThis is a piece I wrote for my [blog](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/redletteralex) where I cover lots of different things about philosophy and stuff. I just wanted to present it here and get some responses from the community of /r/philosophy  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The mind-body problem is one of the classic problems of philosophy, the modern formulation of which belongs to René Descartes. Simply put, the problem is “how do physical neurological brain states relate to phenomenal mental states?” Descartes tried to solve the problem by saying that the mind and body are not the same and that they are both irreducible primitive substances that have the capacity to influence and cause things in each other. His solution rests on a condition for identity, that is, two things are identical if and only if they share all the same properties. As Descartes defined the mind as a non-extended thinking thing and defined body as an extended non-thinking thing, it follows from his criteria for identity that they cannot by identical for they do not share the same properties. Descartes solution to the problem has a lot of points of contention though. Firstly, how can an immaterial substance (mind) interact with a corporeal substance (body)? According to the Principle of Causal Closure (PCC) all physical effects are entirely exhausted by their physical causes which seems to leave no room for the mind to do any causal work. Moreover, how do we know for certain that the mind is a non-extended thing and how do we know that body is a non-thinking thing? His argument seems to commit the fallacy of the petitio pricinple, that is it begs the question by assuming that mind and body do not have the same properties. Descartes version of substance dualism has long been out of popularity in contemporary philosophy, but it is still widely discussed for its historical importance in setting up the modern day formulation of the mind/body problem.  

During the middle of the 20th century a new solution of the mind body problem arose from the like of philosophers such as U.T. Place and Herbert Feigl. Called the type-identity theory, it proposes that neurological brain states and mental states are not distinct and merely correlated, but they are in fact the same thing, that is, they are identical. An example commonly used is the mental state of being in pain. According to they type identity theory the mental state of being in pain is identical to the neurological state of c-fibers firing. In other words, being in pain just is c-fibers firing. This allows for a dissolution of the causal problem of substance dualism. Mental states have causal efficacy in virtue of being identical to physical brain states. It also allows for a simplification of theories of the mind/brain. Following Occam’s Razor, which states that the simplest explanation is most always the correct one, denying the existence of irreducible physical and mental “stuff” and instead positing only one substance simplifies our picture of the world into a less complex narrative. It is important to realize that this is an ontological thesis about the mind, not a linguistic thesis. Of course we use irreducible mental terms to describe our experience (i.e. “wants”, “desires”, knows”…) but the goal of the project is not to translate these utterances into sentences about synapses, electrons, quarks and the like. The point is that on an ontological level, mental states are identical to physical brain states, regardless of what on the surface our language about mental states and entities implies.  

The type-identity theory of the mind rests on the premise that mental types or kinds are realizable in a one to one correspondence with physical types or kinds. But are we really justified in making this assumption? According to some philosophers such as Hilary Putnam and David Lewis, a singular mental type or kind can be realized by many different physical types or kinds. The argument for this kinda of multiple realizability goes as follows: Say we encounter an alien species that, physiologically, is completely different than humans. Instead of having neural electrical signals for communication from the brain to the rest of the body, this alien species has empty sacs that fill with water or some other fluid. Now lets say we decide to poke at this alien with something sharp. Upon viewing its behavior; it moves away from the stimulus, makes an unpleasant sound, actively avoids the sharp object we poked it with, we would be justified in asserting that the alien is in a state of being in pain. However, since the alien has a vastly different physiology than us, it has no c-fibers to fire, it seems that the same mental type, being in a state of pain, is realized by a physical type that is distinct from c-fibers firing. Since the same mental state of being in pain can be realized by different physical states, it makes sense to say that that mental type is not identical to either physical type, for remember, things are identical if and only if they share all the same properties. If mental states are realizable by many distinct physical states, then it follows that mental states cannot be identical to physical states. This is a powerful objection to the type-identity theory of the mind and has been used to advocate a functionalist theory of mental states.  

Simply put, functionalist theories of the mind assert that mental states are not strictly identical to physical states, but instead can be described by the functional role they play in a larger system. So in our alien example, the mental state of being in pain can be reduced to the functional role it plays in the behavior of the alien, that is, its reaction the being poked with a sharp object. So the mental state of being in pain is described by the causal role it plays by causing other mental states such as the belief that one is in pan, the desire to relieve the pain, the behavior one exhibits when in pain, etc… Any internal state that mediates a similar pattern of causes and effects is pain—regardless of the specific physical mechanisms that mediate the pattern in any given case. Functionalism of the mind works well with comparative neuro-anatomy and physiology between humans and other species as it allows us to keep constant our usages of certain mental predicates such as “being in pain” or “desires” even though the underlying physical mechanism that ground such mental states are physically distinct. Not only is this a logically cohesive idea, it is also grounded in scientific methodology by allowing a sufficiently general schema to capture explanations which seems to be a necessary prescriptive condition for something to be considered a genuine science.  

Notice that functionalist theories of the mind are still physicalist theories of the mind. Physical brain states have ontological primacy in that mental states are dependent on them for their existence, but mental states cannot be fully reduced in a one to one correspondence with brain states. The relationship between the two can be said to be one of supervenience. A cursory definition of supervenience would be that there can be no difference in one without a difference in the other. For example, imagine a set of points in space time that are equidistant from each other so that the set has rotational symmetry. The symmetry of the set of points supervenes on the positions of the individual points; if we move one of the points, the set no longer has symmetry. The symmetry of the set supervenes on the relations between the points in the set such that if we change the position of the points, we no longer have a symmetrical across the set. Notice however that supervenience does not necessarily entail strong reduction. Semantic content of sentences does supervene on syntactical feature of the sentence, but they are not reducible to syntactical feature of the sentence. In much the same way, mental states can be said to supervene on brain states, but are not reducible to brain states.  

Functionalism is a popular position in contemporary philosophy of mind, but that does not mean it is without substantive objections. One possible objection is to deny that similar mental kinds are realized across species. Jaegwon Kim posits that mental kinds are distinct and we must differentiate between “pain-for-a-human” and “pain-for-the-alien”. His argument is an attempt to protect the identity-theory of the mind against multiple realizability arguments. Instead of rendering psychology an autonomous special science, multiple realizability implies that there is no structure-independent scientific psychology. There are only “local” scientific psychologies, each reducible to the theory of the underlying physical mechanisms of the structure-type in question. So the verdict on how successful functionalist theories of the mind are is still out and much great work has been done on the problem in question in the past 30 years. For more reading on the topic I’d recommend the SEP entries on type identity theories of the mind (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/) and multiple realizability (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/) as well as Hilary Putnam’s book Representation and Reality.

"The Function of Life and Illusion of PurposeThis is my mind's rambling stream of consciousness from the other day...I'm trying to develop my own philosophy and ""spiritual"" side (not a religious connotation) so I guess I'm looking for input/ constructive criticism... a Kierkegard quote I found after this sent a shiver down my spine due to how similar it was:

 ""The thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. ... I certainly do not deny that I still recognize an imperative of knowledge and that through it one can work upon men, but it must be taken up into my life, and that is what I now recognize as the most important thing."" 
-Søren Kierkegaard

Life is a function who's input is energy(ATP being the final domino of the translation process for us humans) and who's output is (the ability to? free will? or are we just machines constrained to this loop) effectively changing the universe in novel,patterned, and constructive ways. Life reorders the madness of the universe's random chaos into illusions of purpose, for there seems to be no grand purpose other than creating one.

The resource, the energy that this whole process at a psychological level (sustinence such as food, shelter, etc. ignored), THIS EQUATION OF LIFE, requires seems to me to be a BELIEF in some pillars of reality. A healthy, genuine attachment to certain associations, most importantly the ones that derive pleasure and emotions, but there are a myriad of other vital human associations that we must keep to sustain the inertia of our being.

So I suppose by writing this I hope to find a better ""path"" to follow in order to become a happier and constructive person. I will stop intellectualizing here and try to become more observational, visceral, for a static mind is no better than a immutable, stupid robot.The 
human mind gives us the opportunity to transcend meaningless, linear tasks, and create as Dawkins calls it, an illusion of purpose, through the novel output that life is capable of.The WHYS of consciousness seem to allow this human dimension to exist. WHY asks for meaning.. Is WHY the foundation of consciousness and the illusion of purpose? I just asked what WHY means to humans because I want to know WHY the human mind functions. Meta...My mind is streamlined to find purpose. TO 
connect with otherwise meaningless matter. Is that WHY?  because... Does not being ignorant (or being comfortable with being such) lead to meaninglessness, meaning we must pick our beliefs or die, quite literally? (for apathy leads to detrimental consequences...like suicide, being the most extreme...reflecting complete apathy)"

Here are blurbs for each of the Spring 2017 AMA Philosophers:

**Amie L. Thomasson**

[I am](http://thomasson0.wixsite.com/amie-thomasson) a Professor of Philosophy and Cooper Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Miami, soon to be moving to take up a post as Professor of Philosophy at Dartmouth. Lately I have been working largely on questions about the proper value, functions, and methods of metaphysics. I also work on metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of art, philosophy of social and cultural objects, and phenomenology. Earlier in my career I worked a lot on fictional characters, and a lot of my graduate training was in phenomenology. I have published more than 60 articles and three books: [*Fiction and Metaphysics*](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/philosophy/epistemology-and-metaphysics/fiction-and-metaphysics?format=PB) (Cambridge University Press, 1999), [*Ordinary Objects*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ordinary-objects-9780199764440?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2007) and [*Ontology Made Easy*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ontology-made-easy-9780199385119?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2015).

**Samantha Brennan**

**Chris W. Surprenant**

[Chris W. Surprenant](http://chriswsurprenant.com/) is an associate professor of [philosophy at the University of New Orleans](http://www.uno.edu/cola/philosophy/), where I am the founding director of the [Alexis de Tocqueville Project](http://www.uno.edu/tocqueville-project/), an academic center for research and programming focusing on issues at the intersection of ethics, individual freedom, and the law. His work is at the intersection of moral and political philosophy, and his current projects apply this knowledge to contemporary issues in criminal justice reform, including the ethics of punishment; explore the connection between human well-being and entrepreneurship; and examine the influence of the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers on Kant's moral and political philosophy. He has received a handful of awards for his academic work. They include being recognized by Princeton Review in 2012 as one of the ""Best 300 Professors"" in the United States, and by Cengage Learning as one of their ""Most Valuable Professors"" of 2014, awarded to three professors in the United States who ""have made lasting impressions on the education and lives of their students.""

**S. Matthew Liao** 

[I am](http://www.smatthewliao.com/) a philosopher interested in a wide range of issues including ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, moral psychology, and bioethics.

I am also the Editor-in-Chief of the [*Journal of Moral Philosophy*](http://www.brill.com/journal-moral-philosophy), a peer­-reviewed international journal of moral, political and legal philosophy.

**David Chalmers**

I'm a philosopher at NYU and ANU.  I'm interested in consciousness:
e.g. the [hard problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf)
(see also [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_chalmers_how_do_you_explain_consciousness) TED
talk), the [science of
consciousness](http://consc.net/papers/scicon.pdf), [zombies](http://consc.net/zombies.html), and [panpsychism](http://consc.net/papers/panpsychism.pdf).  Lately I've been thinking a lot about the philosophy of technology: e.g. the [extended mind](http://consc.net/papers/extended.html) (another [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksasPjrYFTg)), the [singularity](http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf), and
especially the [universe
as a simulation](http://consc.net/papers/matrix.pdf) and [virtual reality](http://consc.net/papers/virtual.pdf).  I
have a sideline in metaphilosophy: e.g. [philosophical progress](http://consc.net/papers/progress.pdf), [verbal disputes](http://consc.net/papers/verbal.pdf), and [philosophers' beliefs](http://consc.net/papers/survey.pd).
I help run [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org) and other
online resources.  Here's my [website](http://consc.net/chalmers) (it was cutting edge in
1995) and here's my [life story](http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/david-chalmers/).

**Lisa Bortolotti**

[I am](http://www.lisabortolotti.com/) Professor of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham. I studied Philosophy in my hometown, Bologna, before completing masters at King’s College London and the University of Oxford. I got my PhD from the Australian National University in Canberra. After a research position in Manchester, where I worked primarily on ethical issues emerging from the biomedical sciences, I joined the Philosophy Department at Birmingham. I was awarded the American Philosophical Association Book Prize for [*Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/delusions-and-other-irrational-beliefs-9780199206162?cc=us&lang=en&) (OUP 2009). My latest book is [*Irrationality*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745647839.html) (Polity 2014).

My research interests are in empirically-informed philosophy of mind. I am especially interested in the strengths and limitations of human cognition and my work focuses on some familiar and some more unsettling instances of inaccurate or irrational belief, including cases of prejudice and superstition, self-deception, optimism bias, delusion, confabulation, and memory distortion. I am currently leading a five-year project funded by the European Research Council on [*Pragmatic and Epistemic Role of Factually Erroneous Cognitions and Thoughts* (PERFECT)](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/perfect.aspx), where I ask whether beliefs that are false or irrational can have benefits in terms of bringing about some dimension of success or even furthering agents’ epistemic goals. I argue for the view that there is no qualitative gap between the irrationality of those beliefs that are regarded as symptoms of mental health issues and the irrationality of everyday beliefs. I hope my research and that of my team will contribute to undermining the stigma commonly associated with mental health issues.

In the blog I founded in 2013, [*Imperfect Cognitions*](http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/), academic experts at all career stages and experts by experience discuss belief, emotion, rationality, mental health, and much more.

**Shannon Vallor**

[Shannon Vallor](http://www.shannonvallor.net/) is the William J. Rewak, S.J. Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley. Her areas of specialization are the philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and the ethics of emerging technologies. She is President of the Society for Philosophy and Technology, an executive board member of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, and the 2015 winner of the World Technology Award in Ethics.

Her current research focuses on the impact of emerging technologies, particularly those involving automation, on the moral and intellectual habits, skills and virtues of human beings - our character. Her work investigates how human character is being transformed by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, new social media, surveillance and biomedical technologies, and appears in journals such as *Ethics and Information Technology*, *Philosophy and Technology*, and *Techné*, as well as a 2016 book from Oxford University Press: [*Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=us&lang=en&).

**L.A. Paul**

Some experiences change what you know and understand. In this way, these experiences change you. Some change you so dramatically and so profoundly that they change who you are in some deep and life-altering way. Such experiences transform you. In my recent book, [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), I develop this idea and use it to argue that we can’t rationally control and plan our lives in the way we ordinarily think we can. The idea, at a deeper level, is about the metaphysical structure of the self, and how we can form and construct ourselves through life-changing experiences over time. I’m deeply interested in the nature of transformative experience and what it implies for the rationality of big life decisions, authenticity, and the nature of the self. Related questions I’m working on now include: What is the mind doing when it is disoriented in time? Is it rational to choose to have a chip implanted in my brain and gain a new sense modality? What is the modal and psychological structure of self-deception? How is fear of transformation involved in the fear of having new ideas? What can first person shooter-style computer games and virtual reality experiences teach us about the nature of the immersed self?  

I’m a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. I’m also a Professorial Fellow of the Arche ì Research Centre at the University of St Andrews. My main research interests are in metaphysics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind. I focus my writing on the nature of the self, temporal experience, causation, causal experience, time and time’s arrow, perception, mereology, constitution, and essence. My latest book is [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), published by Oxford University Press in 2014. You can learn more about my research and read or listen to various discussions of it in the New Yorker, The Guardian, The New York Times, the BBC, NPR, and other venues at [www.lapaul.org](http://www.lapaul.org/).

**Jay L. Garfield**

[Jay L Garfield](https://jaygarfield.org/) is Doris Silbert Professor in the Humanities and Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Buddhist Studies at Smith College, Visiting Professor of Buddhist Philosophy at Harvard Divinity School, Professor of Philosophy at Melbourne University and Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at the Central University of Tibetan Studies.  Prof Garfield’s research addresses topics in the foundations of cognitive science and the philosophy of mind; the history of Indian philosophy during the colonial period; topics in ethics, epistemology and the philosophy of logic; methodology in cross-cultural interpretation; and topics in Buddhist philosophy, particularly Indo-Tibetan Madhyamaka and Yogācāra.

**Kenny Easwaran**

My main work is on formal epistemology and decision theory, with some particular interests in the epistemology of mathematics, and understanding the use of mathematics in describing the world (and particularly in describing our beliefs and decisions).

I started my undergraduate career at Stanford interested in math and music, but after a philosophy of science class and some logic classes, I decided to add philosophy. For my PhD, I attended UC Berkeley's program in Logic and the Methodology of Science, which gave me flexibility to continue advanced mathematical study while preparing for a career in philosophy (though I initially thought I was going to do the opposite). After getting my PhD in 2008, I spent two semesters as a postdoc at the Australian National University, and started a tenure track job at the University of Southern California. In 2014, as my partner was searching for tenure track jobs (he works on nanomaterials for solar energy), we managed to find positions for both of us at Texas A&M University, where I now have tenure.

Most of my work focuses on issues in probability and decision theory, and particularly paradoxes that arise with infinity. One might think that the finitude of our minds means we can only ever consider finitely many possibilities when reasoning about the world. But there are in fact infinitely many ways things could be, and we can implicitly reason about them through our use of language and mathematics, and we never have sufficient information to narrow things down to a finite list of possibilities, unless we ignore the distinctions we can talk about.

I'm happy to answer questions about anything I've worked on, or anything else that sounds interesting. If you want to read some of my work, you can find it all on my website:

"
"The Meaning Of Life: My Analysis And ThoughtsThis is a question that has been asked since humans first became  conscious intelligent beings. It is arguably the most powerful question  in philosophy, and the one that is most often associated with it. There  have been many different answers to this question throughout history.  Different philosophers, scientists and historians have all attempted to  give their unique spin to the question “what is the meaning of life?”.  In today’s post, I am going to examine some of these ideas, break down  the question into smaller pieces, and articulate my own response to this  philosophical inquiry.

**Before we begin this journey, we must first define two important and relevant terms; the concepts “life” and “meaning”.**  

Let’s first look at three definitions for the word “life”:

1. The condition that distinguishes animals and plants  from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,  functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2. The existence of an individual human being or animal.
3. The period between the birth and death of a living thing, especially a human being.

Let’s now look at three definitions for the word “meaning”:

1. What is meant by a concept?
2. What is the significance of a concept?
3. What is the important or worthwhile quality of a concept?

**Now that we have defined both concepts, let’s break things down even further.**

When we are asking “what is the meaning of life?”, we are essentially asking the following 3 questions:

1. What is life?
2. What is life’s significance?
3. How does one live life in the best possible manner?

After having answered these questions, we will be able to synthesize  all of our ideas and create a response to the question that is the  subject of this article.

**What is life?**

As mentioned earlier, life is the condition that distinguishes  animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for  growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change  preceding death.

**Let’s dive deeper into some of these properties.**

1. Organization. Living things are highly organized,  meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living  organisms are made up of one or more cells, which are considered the  fundamental units of life.
2. Metabolism. Living things must use  energy and consume nutrients to carry out the chemical reactions that  sustain life, such as growing, reproducing and maintain the structure of  their bodies.
3. Homeostasis. The maintenance of a stable internal  environment, even in the face of a changing external environment, is  known as homeostasis.
4. Growth. Living organisms undergo regulated growth.
5. Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce themselves to create new organisms.
6. Response: Living organisms show “irritability,” meaning that they respond to stimuli or changes in their environment.
7. Evolution:  Populations of living organisms can undergo evolution, meaning that the  genetic makeup of a population may change over time.

While understanding this list of properties will not greatly affect  our day-to-day framework of how we think and live our lives, it is still  important to know the difference between a living organism and  non-living entity.

**The next question one might have is, how did life begin?**

Many scientists believe that chemical reactions led to RNA, which was  the first molecule on Earth to self-replicate and begin the process of  evolution that led to more advanced forms of life, including human  beings.

**Now that we know how life began in general, let’s examine how life began for human beings.**

Humans evolved from a species known as Homo erectus. Furthermore,  humans share a common ancestor with chimpanzees. For most of our species  history, we were not the dominant force we are today; we were somewhere  in the middle of the animal food chain. Everything changed during the  cognitive revolution that occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago.

We discovered fire, created tools, and developed language. The most  important thing we did was create and connect around ideas that do not  physically exist, such as religion, politics and capitalism. This level  of imagination and consciousness is something that no other living  entity possesses. It is thanks to the cognitive revolution that we are  the dominant, intelligent and conscious beings that we know ourselves to  be today, and it is thanks to our consciousness that we are able to ask  questions such as “what is the meaning of life?”.

**Another big question that we have is the question of how the Universe started.**

The Big Bang theory is the most commonly accepted response to this.

* The Big Band theory is the prevailing cosmological model  explaining the existence of the observable universe form the earliest  known period through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model  describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high  density and temperature.

In recent years, another theory called String theory has gotten quite popular.

* In String theory, the multiverse is a hypothetical group of  multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that  exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and  the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different  universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”, “other  universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”.

We now understand what characteristics separate living organisms from  inorganic matter, how life began, how humans evolved, and why humans  are different from other living organisms. Furthermore, we are able to  somewhat understand what the Universe is and how it started.

**However, we are still left with many questions.**

Are we special? Are we the only intelligent and conscious entities in  the universe or in the multiverse? Is anything “real”, or are we living  in a simulation? Does God exist? Is there life after death? How do all  of the complexities of the Universe work? Is there a deeper purpose to  life or are we merely just bodies of carbon living in a world that is  random and that does not care about us?

Unfortunately, these questions have no objective answers to them. The  deeper we dig, the more questions we have. Science can only answer so  much. There is only so much we can understand about life, about  existence and about the Universe. String theory says that there are 11  dimensions. Humans are only equipped to experience and understand 4 of  those dimensions. With that being said, the progress that we have made  in the last few hundred years has been remarkable. With every year that  passes, we understand a little bit more about the Universe and about  ourselves.

We are curious beings and we are wired to want to explore, to ask  questions, and to try to find answers to the mysteries of the world.

**What is life’s significance?**

As mentioned, we will never know whether we are merely just bodies of  carbon living in a vast apathetic and random Universe, or whether there  is a deeper purpose to our lives and to our existence. With that being  said, life is still meaningful and significant, and the best way to  figure how is to analyze how we are wired as human beings.

Similar to how machines and robots are wired to think and behave in  certain ways, human beings are wired to want and desire certain things.  If there is one thing I want to emphasize in this section, it’s that  while technology and culture have progressed drastically over the last  100 years, we still have the same desires that we had thousands of years  ago and we have not changed much biologically over that time span. The  only difference between today and two thousand years ago is that we are  now satisfying our desires and needs in newer and more complex ways.

**Physical survival.**

Survival is the deepest and most important instinct that we have. As  mentioned earlier in this article, for most of our specie’s history we  were somewhere in the middle of the animal food chain. Without good  health and a good environment, life is difficult and filled with  suffering. No baby is born ready to give up and commit suicide. It takes  a process full of corruption and suffering for a human being to get to  that point. Humans and animals are wired to want to live. As Abraham  Maslow points out in his hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety  needs are the foundation of his pyramid.

While physical survival used to be the act of running from a tiger or  getting shelter in a cave, physical survival today in the western world  is eating healthy, making money, investing, going to the gym, attaining  influence and power, sleeping well, etc.

**Reproduction.**

Reproduction is survival in a different form; survival of our genes  and of our specie. We are wired to want to procreate. Evolution made the  act of sex enjoyable. Our desire for reproduction has not changed.  What’s changed is that as a result of newer technologies, safety and  security, and world dominance, people realize that taking care of  children is a time-consuming lifestyle and choose to focus on their  other needs and goals first, keeping their desire for children as  something to explore later in their lives. Thanks to technological  advancements such as birth control and abortion, people have more  control over their lives and are able to enjoy the benefits of sex  without its consequences.

**Belongingness and Love.**

Humans beings are social animals. We are not meant to live in  isolation. In large part, the way we learn, understand ourselves and the  world, maintain our health and sanity, and think about and solve  problems is by communicating and cooperating with others. There is a  concept that is known as Dunbar’s number. It is essentially a claim that  humans can maintain no more than 150 friendships and connections at a  time. Yuval Noah Harari’s talks about this in detail in his book  “Sapiens”.

Yuval went on to explain that the reason we are able to cooperate in  large groups and dominate the world despite our cognitive limit to the  number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships,  is because of our ability to connect around shares beliefs, such as  stoicism, Christianity, capitalism, money, etc. This shows just how  important connecting with others is for us. In fact, our ability to  communicate and connect with others is one of the biggest reasons how we  went from being in the middle of the animal food chain to the civilized  and dominant people we are today.  

In connection with this desire to connect with others, we are also  wired to want to love and to be loved. Love is crucial for a child’s development. Without adequate love at  an early age during sensitive and critical periods, children develop  attachment issues that can affect them for the rest of their lives. This  shows just how crucial love is for us. Even when we grow up and become  teenagers and adults, we are still yearning for belongingness and love.  It might be something as simple as having anxiety in high school because  we don’t feel as though we have good friends. It might be the  experience of being depressed because a close family member passed away  and we regret not having told them how much we love them. It might be  throwing a fun surprise birthday party for a best friend or sibling  because of how much we cherish them.

Our desire and need to love and to be loved shows itself in numerous  ways throughout our lives. Christopher McCandless wrote this before his  death, “Happiness only real when shared”. This was coming from a man who  had escaped humanity his whole life and who lived his final days in  isolation in the wilderness. Despite pushing people away his entire  life, McCandless realized moments before his death that our lives are  meaningless if we are not surrounded by loved ones.

Another important form of love is self-love. At the end of day, the  only person that will be there with us at every moment of our lives is  ourselves. It is therefore crucial to have a good relationship with  ourselves. If we can’t love ourselves then how can we expect others to  love us? Ayn Rand put this idea beautifully with this quote, “To say ‘I  love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.”

**Curiosity.**

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Europe with  three ships. The explorer and navigator who completed four voyages  across the Atlantic Ocean is known today as one of the most important  figures in history, opening the way for widespread European exploration  and the colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first  European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Christopher Columbus, as well as the thousands of others throughout  history who put their lives at risk for the sake of curiosity and  exploration, did so because they did not want humanity to be forever  bounded by geography and ignorance. The Apollo Lunar Module Eagle  landing on the moon on July 20, 1969 is another example of humankind  attempting to expend its horizons. History is filled with pioneers and  giants from all fields; people like Socrates, Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da  Vinci, Martin Luther King Jr, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,  etc.

Going out of our comfort zones, taking risks, being creative,  expending our horizons, being curious, asking questions, trying new  things, and exploring the earth and space is something that is deeply  ingrained in us. Our desire to explore and to be curious is something  that sets us apart from all other living organisms; it’s what makes us  unique.

Curiosity doesn’t always have to lead to world-changing events like  stepping on the moon or discovering America. Sometimes, curiosity can be  something as simple as sitting down and writing a paper on a topic we  find interesting. Curiosity can be the experience of taking a vacation  and visiting countries and cultures we have never seen. Curiosity can be  the decision to indulge in good habits and to stick to them despite the  discomfort they may cause at first. Curiosity can be the process of  starting a business on an idea we are passionate about. Curiosity is all  around us, and it is one of the most primal instincts that we have.  Let’s embrace our curiosity and our desire for exploration, and let’s  create lives that we will be proud of.  

**Legacy.**

As mentioned earlier, one of the instincts that motivates us the  instinct for survival. We have already talked about two forms of  survival in this article; physical survival and the survival of our  genes and of our specie. There is a third form of survival that controls  much of what we do in life; spiritual survival. Immortality is a desire  that is primal to us. We have the gift of consciousness, but also its  curse. We are the only living organism that is able to imagine and think  about its own death. We don’t want to die. It’s in our nature to desire  survival. For that reason, we try to stay healthy and to physically  survive for as long as can.

However, physical survival is often not enough. We understand  consciously that there will come a time when our bodies will no longer  be able to function. We understand that we will physically die one day.  For that reason, some people turn to religion and God and believe that  if they live a life following certain commandments and behaving in  certain ways, then they will go to heaven and live for eternity. Others  understand that the afterlife is something that we don’t fully  understand. Is there an afterlife? What happens after death? Despite  physical death, will our spirits and souls live on?

These are all pertinent questions. I have the view that there are  certain things that we can’t control. We can’t control what happens to  us after we die. We can control, however, what we do in this life. We  are not guaranteed the promise of heaven. For that reason, we must turn  our attention to building the best legacy we can. Perhaps our name will  be able to live on for generations. Perhaps the value that we will have  given to humankind will play a role in immortalizing our spirit. Perhaps  the legacy we desire is what we leave behind to our children, to our  family, and to our loved ones.

There is a reason that we still remember the names of some of  history’s greatest and most ambitious. There is a reason we still  remember Socrates, his Socratic method of questioning and the honor he  showed in the face of death. There is a reason we still remember Julius  Caesar, the empire he built, and how his empire played a large role in  the development of modern government. There is a reason we remember  Galileo, why we call him the father of observational astronomy, why we  call him the father of the scientific method, and how he stood up for  his beliefs and was a contrarian at a time when going against the grain  could get one killed. There is a reason we will remember Elon Musk long  after he is dead, and his contributions to electric vehicles, space  travel, and clean energy.

The desire for legacy is a great one; there is a lot of meaning that  can be found in its pursuit. The desire for prestige, for  accomplishment, for competition, and for status are some of the most  primal desires that we have. Abraham Maslow, the prominent psychologist  includes esteem needs and self-actualisation as part of his hierarchy of  needs.

It’s important to understand that only a few will be able to have  their names and work immortalized for centuries. Let’s not let that  derail us. It is not the final product that counts. It is the process of  working on something that is greater than ourselves that is of  paramount significance here. In order to build a great legacy, it is  important to help others, to provide value, and to try to push humanity  forward.

Some people will argue that the desire to work towards a great legacy  is stupid. They will argue that one day humans will go extinct and that  when this happens, nobody will know Galileo, Napoleon, Einstein, or  whoever else we want to name. This is a strong logical argument. The  reason I disagree with this view, however, is that logic is not always  the most important factor in an argument. If there’s one thing I want to  make clear in this article, it’s the important of meaning and of  purpose. Where is the meaning in nihilism? Where is the purpose in  believing that we are insignificant and that our lives will mean nothing  millions of years from now?

Despite the fact that these statements may both be logically correct,  what we are trying to articulate in this article is a framework that  will be helpful in our day-to-day lives. A desire for legacy is not only  deeply wired in us, but it is also honorable to want to better  ourselves and to want to better the world. It is honorable to want to  leave behind a piece of who we are, whether in the form of family, in  the form writing, in the form of art, in the form of inventions, in the  form of exploration, or in whatever other medium we choose.

**Acquiring knowledge and transferring it to future generations.**  

If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s the importance of  protecting our species’ knowledge and successfully transferring it  across generations. This goes back to our desire for survival, and more  specifically our desire for the survival of our species. If we do not  safeguard our knowledge, then how can we make sure that the human  species will progress? How can we make sure that we will learn from  history and not commit mistakes that we have committed in the past? We  can’t. It is why books have always been valuable.

Walking in a library is one of the most surreal things that one can  experience. In a library, we have the ability to read from the greatest  minds of human history; Plato, Aristotle, Albert Einstein, Stephen  Hawking, Will Durant, etc. We have more books and more wisdom than can  last a lifetime. Furthermore, our brain is a muscle and it must be  trained. If we spend our days mindlessly scrolling social media and not  putting our brain to use, then we will develop mental problems later in  life and we will not have fulfilled even an ounce of the potential that  we have.

It is our duty to acquire knowledge, to learn as much as we can, and  to put this knowledge into practice. Despite having books and wisdom  from some of the greatest thinkers of all time, our world and our  societies still face many problems. Every era has its own unique set of  problems, and it is our responsibility to learn as much as we can and to  turn our knowledge into practical action. Furthermore, it is our  responsibility transfer our species’ and our personal knowledge to our  kids and future generations so that they will be well equipped to deal  with the challenges of their time.

**Well-being.**

If there is one thing that almost all religions, philosophies, and  schools of thought have in common, it’s that they aim to reduce  suffering and increase well-being.

* Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and  prosperity. It includes having good mental health, high life  satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to manage  stress.

The desires to reduce stress, and to experience happiness and  prosperity are fundamental to who we are. Throughout much of our  species’ history, we experienced wars, diseases, natural catastrophes,  etc. Christopher Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author  wrote the following, “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely  at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history”. This  is a fascinating statistic.

As mentioned earlier, our desires for competition and status, and our  instinct to separate into groups are all part of what makes us human.  Despite all the good that has come from those desires, there has also  been a lot of suffering that has resulted from them. The world can  sometimes be a cruel place filled with evil. It is for this reason that  so many religions and philosophies have attempting to figure out ways in  which we can reduce suffering.

A large part of well-being has to do with health. Gut health, for  example, is strongly correlated with mental health. It is for this  reason that people who have gut problems suffer in life satisfaction. To  be happy, healthy, and to prosper are goals that everyone has. A big  part of making progress towards those goals is combining a lot of the  things that have already talked about in prior sections of this article.  Are we living healthy lives? Are we constantly trying to learn more and  expend our horizons? Do we feel loved and are we surrounded by people  who cherish us? Are we working on our legacies and on projects that  excite us, or are we wasting our time and potential?

Happiness is not something that should be chased. The more we chase  happiness, the more miserable we will be. There is a great book about  this topic called “The Language of Emotions”. It’s important for us to  understand that all emotions are equally important, and that each  emotion serves its own unique purpose. Anger, for example, allows us to  create boundaries. Sadness allows us to release energy. Fear lets us  know when we are in danger. We need to allow happiness to come as a  by-product of a life well-lived, and when it does come, we need let it  be free like a bird; it will come and go when it pleases.

Contentment is a far better thing to aim for. When we are content, we  are grateful for everything that we have. With that being said, we  still try to get a little bit better every day. Mindfulness is also  important. In today’s world of over-stimulation, instant gratification,  and constant comparison, it is easy for us to spend much of our time  either stressing about the future or being depressed about the past.  It’s important to take a step back, to be grateful, and to ask ourselves  what we can do today to better our lives and to create good habits.

Finally, we need to understand that well-being is something that is  unique to each of us. What motivates me and makes me happy, might be  different than what motivates you and makes you happy. It is our  responsibility to have self-awareness, to understand ourselves, and to  understand what drives us.

**How does one live life in the best possible manner?**

Let’s look at what some famous thinkers, philosophies, religions, and schools of thought have said about this.

**Stoicism.**

* Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in  Athens in the early 3rd c entury BC. It is a philosophy of personal  ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural  world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to meaning  and happiness is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,  by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or  by the fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to  do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating  others fairly and justly.

Stoicism was the primary philosophy during the time of the Roman  Empire. The beautiful thing about Stoicism is that arguably the two most  famous Stoics in history came from completely opposing situations and  classes; Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a man who was born  a slave. Despite their complete opposing life situations, both Marcus  Aurelius and Epictetus wrote and talked about all of the same Stoic  virtues. In recent years, Stoicism has had a resurgence. Marcus  Aurelius’ journal “Meditations” is now one of the most famous books in  the world. Furthermore, books from modern writers such as Ryan Holiday  have brought Stoicism into the mainstream.

**Existentialism.**

* Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores  the problem of human existence and centers on the lived experience of  the thinking, feeling, acting individual. In the view of the  existentialist, the individual’s starting point has been called “the  existential angst,” a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or  anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.  Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the  meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were some of the first and most important existentialists.

* Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is  that existence precedes essence, which means that individuals shape  themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived  categories, an “essence”. The actual life of the individuals is what  constitutes what could be called their “true essence” instead of an  arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings,  through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a  meaning to their life.

**Epicureanism.**

* Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BC  based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.  Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable  pleasure in the form of tranquility and freedom from fear, and the  absence of bodily pain through knowledge of the workings of the world  and limiting desires.
* Epicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life.  Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest  amount of pleasure possible during one’s lifetime yet doing so  moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in  such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than  on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially  produced desires were to be suppressed.

**Objectivism.**

* Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by  Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in  her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged  (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books. Rand described  Objectivism as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own  happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement  as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”.

I read a large portion of the book “The Fountainhead” about a year  ago and I enjoyed it. This is one of the passages that has stuck with  me.

* “It is not in the nature of man–nor of any living entity–to start out by  giving up, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that  requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man.  Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run  down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or  how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their  elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning  one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’s values; practicality, of  losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that  fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and  reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek  a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.”

The reason I like this passage so much is because it communicates in  very clear and poetic terms the idea that a desire for meaning and that a  desire for improvement and greatness are core elements of who we are.

**Logotherapy.**

* Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor  Frankl. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the  belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most  powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to  this system is given in Frankl’s most famous book, Man’s Search for  Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his  Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and  reinforced his theories.
* According to Frankl, “We can discover this meaning in life in  three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by  experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude  we take toward unavoidable suffering” and that “everything can be taken  from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose  one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.

**My Thoughts.**

As can be seen, there exists many great schools of thoughts and  philosophies. What almost all of them have in common is the emphasis  they place on pursuing meaning. We live in a world filled with instant  gratification, overstimulation, misinformation, censorship, anxiety and  fearmongering. Furthermore, we live in a world and in an environment  that pedestalizes short-term harmful pleasure and makes it difficult to  delay gratification and pursue meaningful projects and activities. It is  our duty as individuals to take responsibility for our lives, to work  to better ourselves in incremental fashion, to work to better the world,  to try to enjoy the process of life, to love ourselves, and to pursue  meaning rather than short-term detrimental pleasure.

As mentioned earlier in his article, the are many existential and  philosophical questions that we are not able to answer. Perhaps with the  advancement of science we will one day be able to better comprehend the  complexities of the Universe. However, for the time being, we must  focus on what we can control as individuals and create frameworks for  thinking and living that are helpful for our development.

I believe that a large part of the meaning of life is to live  according to our instincts; maintaining good health, being surrounded by  people we love, working on our legacies, acquiring knowledge,  transferring our knowledge across generations, procreating, and placing  great importance on our well-being. However, it’s important to also  understand that we are not chained by our instincts. Each of us have  something special in us that gives us the ability to think and to be  creative. This ability to be flexible, to explore, to try new things, to  learn from great thinkers and philosophers, to go outside of our  comfort zones, to take risk, to go against the grain, to be contrarians,  to be creative, to think outside the box, and to constantly ask  questions and find solutions is what makes us special.

Going back to Viktor Frankl, one of my favorite quotes is the  following, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that  space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our  growth and our freedom.”

I want to emphasize once more that there is meaning in life and that  this meaning can be found all around us. We sometimes see people who  have fallen into nihilism. As someone who once fell into nihilism,  perhaps I can shed some light on my experience and on why nihilism can  be appealing.

* Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that  nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with  extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

The reason I fell into nihilism was because I was going through a  difficult time in my life. I had just moved cities and schools, and I  had left behind all of my childhood friends and almost everything that  was a constant in my life. This happened when I was a young teenager and  it was the worst experience of my life. At the time, I struggled  greatly with understanding my emotions and with social anxiety. It took  many months for me to finally come to terms with my situation and to get  out of denial. For a long time, I tried to convince myself that my  situation was okay and that everything would be alright. I struggled  with anxiety, with depression, and with many more problems.

With that being said, the story has a happy ending; I got closure and  I now live a life where I am generally happy and motivated. My point  with this entire story is that sometimes our life experiences lead us to  philosophies that serve as defence mechanisms. Nihilism, as well as the  belief that free will does not exist, allowed me to tell myself, “life  is meaningless, and I have no control over my situation”. Nihilism was  an escape. The rose-coloured glasses that I had been so accustomed to  wearing had turned into dark-coloured glasses. I was seeing the world  through a completely different lens. When we feel that there is no  meaning in life, it’s probably because something has gone terribly wrong  in our lives.

Of course, this is not always the case. There are plenty of nihilists  out there that believe in nihilism because they believe it to be the  most logical framework for understanding the world. However, as  mentioned earlier in this article, logic is not the only way to go about  looking for truth and examining topics such as the meaning of life;  emotions and instincts are sometimes just as important. An obsession  with logic leads to skepticism. David Hume demonstrated this with “the  problem of induction”. The problem of induction essentially explains  that nothing in the Universe can be proven for certainty. The problem of  induction, as mind-boggling as it is, demonstrates that the odds of the  sun rising tomorrow are equal to the odds of the sun not rising  tomorrow. That is the problem when we put logic on a pedestal and don’t  consider other important factors.

Nihilism is not natural because it looks at the world through a  pessimistic and defeatist lens, which is antithetical to how we are  wired and to who we are as human beings. No baby is born a nihilist.  Going back to Ayn Rand’s quote, “It is not in the nature of man–nor of  any living entity–to start out by giving up, by spitting in one’s own  face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose  rapidity differs from man to man.”

With closure, with life experiences, with the process of slowly  improving, with information on how to deal with grief, and with  knowledge on life and existence, I went from being a nihilist to the  person I am today, the person I have always truly been; someone who  looks at the world with a glass half-full, someone who looks at the  world with curiosity, wonder and love, and someone who believes in  meaning, pursues meaning, and lives a life of meaning.

To further emphasize my point that life has meaning, and that  striving for meaning is natural and a core part of who we are, let’s  look at the science. Psychologist Jordan Peterson talks about the  orienting reflex in many of his lectures online. He explains that our  brain produces a very complex internal model of the world, and that our  senses produce a model of the external world. The hippocampus watches  those two models to see if they match, and if they don’t match, then a  mismatch signal is created; the orienting reflex.

* The orienting reflex is an organism’s immediate response to a  change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to  elicit the startle reflex. The orienting reflex is a reaction to novel  or significant stimuli.

The orienting reflex essentially serves as a compass of meaning for  us; it is an instrument that guides us through life. It is one of the  deepest instincts that we have. The best way to articulate this point is  by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, M. J. DeMarco:

* “Your soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced  with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or  during a massage. How are you responding to your soul’s voice? Is it  denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work?  Distracted by a television? Honored?”

When we are wasting time and when we are indulging in behaviours and  activities that lack meaning, that are unnatural, and that are  antithetical to growth, our orienting reflex will let us know. It is our  responsibility to listen to our voice, to accept the mistakes that  we’ve made, and to take steps towards the right direction. Life is  filled with meaning. We must open our eyes and we must embrace this  meaning. Meaning is a core part of who we are, and we must live in  accordance to the instincts and purposes that have been explained and  analyzed in this article. Furthermore, we must also not follow  philosophies and ideas blindly and dogmatically, and we must understand  that the journey of life and the journey of meaning is unique to each of  us.

This article was a collection of thoughts from some of the greatest  thinkers of all time, as well as my own thoughts and my attempt to  synthesize all of this information. It is worth noting that someone  might read this article and not agree with everything. That is okay, and  it is completely normal. Each of us are at a different stage in our  process of life, and we come from different environments and have  different genetics. Despite the objective nature of some of these ideas,  the way I view life and the way you view life will not always be the  same. Two of the most important skills one can have are self-awareness  and critical thinking. If we are able to understand ourselves and our  thought process, and if we are able to question ourselves and to  question the world, then we have what it takes to grow as human beings  and to tackle difficult questions such as “what is the meaning of life?

Best of luck my fellow readers. Please feel free to reach out to me to ask any questions or to discuss some of these ideas!"
"Why We're All Going to Die“Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”- John F. Kennedy

 

The only way out is through. Global society is dependent on artificially inflated energy resources—i.e. oil—that are directly leading us toward total collapse. Technology is being used to most efficiently maximize wealth of the largest corporate conglomerates at the expense of the social fabric and a living environment. The biosphere is in fact collapsing. The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

[iv] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution.Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution. **[This was written BEFORE the Occupy movement began]**


February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"Can killing in the name of good be justified when innocents may also be harmed?During a sleepless night, I typed this out. It is a description of my internal conflict with being a contracted hacker for the government and the morality of my actions. 

**Background Info:**
I am 17. I work for a network security company that does contracting for the government. My work involves gaining access to a specific target using vulnerabilities in consumer devices. Since I do not a have a clearance I am given no information about the target.

**Start:**
I want to know I’m doing the right thing. Because what I do makes me a killer. Not directly, but ultimately what I do may or may not end someone else’s life. Work that I do with law enforcement can put a pedophile behind bars or work with the military can put a bullet through someone’s head in Afghanistan. It wasn’t like this before. Before, it was just the excitement of solving the puzzle, finding that one flaw that would give you unauthorized access. It didn’t feel quite real, at least not until the sudden realization that what I am doing actually affects people’s lives. The realization changes the “I just bypassed the security on that webcam” to “I just got a visual id on the target.” It’s been some months since I realized this and now I can’t stop asking myself the question: “Am I doing the right thing?” 

Personally, I do not believe that our government always makes the right decisions. Our elected officials are people just like us and are likely to make decisions that further their own agenda rather than do the “right” thing. Most of the time, there is no consensus on what the right thing is. There is so much conflict within the government that I cannot believe that without a doubt, the actions it makes are completely justified. What I do to help it can either be good or evil. Did hacking into some foreign computer network help the military kill someone? Maybe. Was he a terrorist? Who knows. I’d like to think that by providing the military with more information, I make it less likely for them to make a mistake, but I can’t be certain of that and I can’t be certain that the target deserved to die. 

So how do I justify my actions to help an entity that punishes people when my faith in its ability to do so fairly is lacking? I have to assume that it makes the correct decisions. I need to tell myself that when my software breaks into someone’s home network, that I am helping society by removing those who cause harm. I tell myself that each network I break into means that there is some little kid won’t be hurt. That one girl won’t have to live the rest of her life in silence and shame because she is scared to speak out. I pray that my work isn’t being abused to help spy on those who are innocent or worse, kill those who are innocent. It’s a huge burden that I place on a single assumption.  

I need to feel verification that I have done the right thing, that even if someone was harmed because of me, it was worth it because many more avoiding suffering. This need makes the words people that say to me have so much more meaning than they intend. Acceptance by others is verification that I have done the right thing while rejection proves that I have made a mistake. Hearing someone say that they trust me puts me in a blissful happiness. On the other hand, the words, “You’re not the right one for me. I just want to be friends” becomes a soul-crushing “You had good intentions, but you have made a terrible mistake and I can’t accept that.” Being aware of my unwarranted translation does nothing to mitigate the feelings it stirs up. I vividly remember a breakup where I was told, “I feel like you are using your depression to take advantage of me.” The shock that put through me was enormous. I had been able to feel like I was doing the right thing by demonizing rapists, pedophiles, generally anyone who takes advantage of others for sex. Now, to be heard that I was one, completely ripped my mind apart. Someone that I cared for did not want to be with me because she thought I was one of them. The rest of the day was spent contemplating quick and painless ways of suicide while a friend ineffectively tried to convince me that it wasn’t true. Honestly, the only thing that saved me was probably the fact that I felt so useless that I couldn’t bring myself to do anything.

Dealing with people has an extra level of difficulty, especially with people who don’t quite understand what I do. It seems that whenever people at school talk about me, the subject is always how much money I make. I have even had several people I do not normally talk to come up to me and inquire about my yearly salary. One such person even friend requested me on Facebook shortly after asking. This question disgusts me. My work decides if people live or die and people’s main concern is gossiping over how much money I make? Is only my pay important? How about catching those pedophiles, is that important? Is it worth the damage I might cause? Am I causing other people’s deaths for the money? I hope not. Just the idea of it sickens me. So I started using a large portion of my paycheck to buy toys for kids in hospitals. I remember when I was learning to program, my brother was in the hospital. The everyday before visiting him, I would frantically be programming a game to let him play on my laptop when I went to visit. He was so excited when he got to play my simple board game. I hope the money I got from my gamble at least brings a smile to others like the one my brother had. At least this helps me hold on to what sanity I have, but the toll this conflict is having on me is becoming more apparent.

I go through most days robotically. I wake up in the morning, go to school, go to work, go home, pass out, then stay up all through the night. Why? Sleep is a curse. I only sleep when my body can no longer handle being awake any longer since my dreams are painful. Some nights I dream of being punished for the fates I’ve brought to others, some nights I dream that I can no longer handle it and kill the ones I know who are guilty, and some nights I dream I am back in the asylum where I belong. If I am lucky, I don’t dream. I am in a different state of mind every day. I may go a few days feeling on top of the world while, on other days, I feel wretched and useless. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone. I can’t stand being unable to control my thoughts and feelings. I can’t help but let my personal relationships be intertwined with my conscience. My aim has always been to protect those who cannot protect themselves and spread happiness to those who suffer. The constant conflict in my mind leaves me lost and confused. I am sorry to those around me that I hurt because I am blind and those who I do not know because I am mistaken. Am I doing the right thing? Did I make the right choice?"
"The First Decade of the Future is Behind Us""Imagine it’s 1995: almost no one but Gordon Gekko and Zack Morris have cellphones, pagers are the norm; dial-up modems screech and scream to connect you an internet without Google, Facebook, or YouTube; Dolly has not yet been cloned; the first Playstation is the cutting edge in gaming technology; the Human Genome Project is creeping along; Mir is still in space; MTV still plays music; Forrest Gump wins an academy award and Pixar releases their first feature film, Toy Story. Now take that mindset and pretend you’re reading the first page of a new sci-fi novel:

The year is 2010. America has been at war for the first decade of the 21st century and is recovering from the largest recession since the Great Depression. Air travel security uses full-body X-rays to detect weapons and bombs. The president, who is African-American, uses a wireless phone, which he keeps in his pocket, to communicate with his aides and cabinet members from anywhere in the world. This smart phone, called a “Blackberry,” allows him to access the world wide web at high speed, take pictures, and send emails.
It’s just after Christmas. The average family’s wish-list includes smart phones like the president’s “Blackberry” as well as other items like touch-screen tablet computers, robotic vacuums, and 3-D televisions. Video games can be controlled with nothing but gestures, voice commands and body movement. In the news, a rogue Australian cyberterrorist is wanted by world’s largest governments and corporations for leaking secret information over the world wide web; spaceflight has been privatized by two major companies, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX; and Time Magazine’s person of the year (and subject of an Oscar-worthy feature film) created a network, “Facebook,” which allows everyone (500 million people) to share their lives online.""

"Philosophy should be a core k-12 class.Philosophy should be just as important as math, science, english, etc, in school. The reason I believe this is because philosophy forces you to know WHY you think something, it forces you to think through opinions/issues LOGICALLY, something that's not done enough.

The ability to use logic (predominantly at least) when discussing ideas and issues is viewed as special and gifted, unnatainable for the average person. The perception of it is that someone like Sam Harris (fascinating guy, look him up) can only think how he does because of genetics, or pure talent. But I doubt that's true. Philosophy is largely logical, just like math (though math is purely logical). Meaning, if we can teach kids to understand 2+2=4, we can teach them to logically account for other people's perspectives and teach them to understand what it truly means to think. Now I don't think many people would argue that Philosophy is useless (not talking about post degree job opportunities here) but I don't think many would argue it's just as important as core classes either.

So why do I believe it's just as important? Because how much time in our lives do we spend talking to people, hearing their ideas, and listening to their perspectives? The answer is a shit ton of time.

If people were educated on the logical formula of thinking (yes, there is one) imagine how much more cooperative we would be. Of course it would change life in general, but imagine how US (or general) politics would be if Philosophy was just as valued as core classes in k-12. Instead of constantly calling each other bigots, racist, libtards, etc the average dinner table political debate could actually be centered around why one opinion/idea would work better than other.

Here is a example of what happens when Philosophy isn't emphasized:

""I think all of those damn illegals need to get out of this country!""

""You're just a intolerant bigot!""

After Philosophy is emphasized:

""I think all of the illegal immigrants need to get out of this country""

""Why? What negative impact do they have?""

""Well they take our jobs""

""But all the evidence and research says they don't""

""But what makes them entitled to US citizenship?""

And back and forth. Instead of name calling, actual logical discussion.

If everyone was trained to take in account a persons life expirence which forms their perspective, be taught the logic that could be used when discussing ideas, and be taught the true nature and meaning of thinking, we would all get along much better, and more would get done.

This is not to say everyone should have the same opinion. That's not what Philosophy is. Take the example above for instance, the one arguing to deport the illegal immigrants is asking why they are inherently allowed to live here, which is a perfectly legitimate philosophical question/opinion. But there is a philosophical counter argument to that point that is just as legitimate. Even if I could wave a magic wand and this all come to fruition, people would disagree constantly. There is a logical formula to thinking but that doesn't mean only one specific result can come out of a certain thought and be logically and philosophically sound. Logic can't completely dictate Philosophy, it just can't. There is a clear, sound, logic to both the pro and anti immigrant persons argument, but mostly it's a moral position, which logic cannot always control. Another example: The discussion of what people think everyone is entitled or not entitled to is a intresting one. When someone says ""all people should have the right to live, so all people deserve healthcare free of charge"" there is a logic to that, but it is a largely moral opinion. The exact same could be true of the opposite opinion ""No one is entitled to anything on this earth, things are earned"". Both of those opinions can't be proven or disproven logically,(er well... At least in the context I'm talking about) but that doesn't make them invalid. Logic can't dictate everything.

So in conclusion: Schools should teach students the nature of thinking, the inherently logical aspect to thinking, and to respect different moral conclusions. Regarding the latter, most people would take that up to a point, many aren't going to sympathize or respect grossly authoritarian or discriminating opinions. Which nothing about philosophical logic and the nature of morality contradicts. I'm not trying to get rid of ""values"" people have at all. Differences of opinion are good, the inability to understand the logic and more often morality of why someone thinks what they do, is not good

EDIT 1: Ok so just saying ""Philosophy"" seems to have (somewhat) convoluted my point. I dont want 6th grader to have to take a year long class about the history of philosophy. I want a class that encourages largely philosophical type thinking, but it shouldn't be teaching everyone about certain Philosophy niches and the full understanding of certain things within Philosophy if that makes sense. Philosophical/logical type thinking with understanding towards different mortalities.. That's what I want the class to be basically. Would most likely have a different name than ""Philosophy"". It would just borrow somethings from Philosophy as we think of the course now.

EDIT 2: So I am a sophomore in high school who wrote the OP to bring up a interesting idea that I would never pretend is perfect. If this were to actually happen, so many kinks and things would need to be figured out and our culture would have to change pretty significantly in the US for this to ever be a reality. I think this has been a pretty cool discussion here and my perspective on this is different than when I first posted it because of the discussion. I did not post this to preach about how terrible everyone is, I posted just to see what people thought about this really. I do really believe that our society could improve with more emphasis on understanding other's perspectives and having a more logical, perhaps rational thinking process on ideas, and other people's ideas. When I said we need more logic, I meant in regards to discussing and perceiving ideas. I'm not saying everyone is illogical about everything because if that were the case there would be no Reddit for me to post on. Or a phone for me to type on. Clearly, we have our fair dose of logic all around. However logic regarding ideas is different than logic regarding most other things. Because with ideas, emotion and bias are thrown in. I would not want to live in a world with no emotion and it's something humans will have forever, well, unless robots or some shit. However, I think many people in the country are allowing their (usually) well intentioned pride and emotion to cloud their ability to have a productive discussion with people that think differently. I'm not going to pretend to not have allowed emotion and pride to cloud my judgement sometimes, of course it has. But I just feel, that if the way of thinking and analyzing ideas in Philosophy was more valued in our culture, we would be more united and productive. Of course we cannot get rid of emotion in our thinking, we never should. But we can become a society that is more critical thinking and productive when discussing ideas. There is no reason why we can't. Clearly I don't mean this will happen in a year, but there is no reason that we can't strive to eventually improve more and more when talking about ideas. As I said in the OP, many ideas are going to be rooted in morality. That's not because they're illogical, it's because that's how many ideas just are. Logic doesn't dictate all ideas. If I said that all humans have certain rights just because they're human dammit, there is no logic to that. But it's not illogical either. It's just a idea my morals lead me to. So often we think people's ideas are ridiculous and just attack them without thinking about why they might have that idea, which only serves to hurt both ways. Of course some ideas are predominantly based in logic, and at that point yeah, some ideas make more sense than others. But even then if you want to actually have a productive conversation with someone who has a different perspective on it, being a cunt isn't going to do anything. Not many people have had their mind expanded because they got called a name and mocked. I also imagine a society, where everyone could name a reason for their opinion. Not only do so many people not""question everything"", so many people question nothing. So many people have strong convictions about things but can't name any actual reason for it, and this doesn't just happen with socially akward adults on Reddit lol. If our education system put more emphasis on our ability to independently think and analyze things we would be better off. This is not to say we should scrap the education system and start from scratch, but we should make more of a effort to encourage critical thinking. Based on some responses on here, I can understand if you think my idea isn't actually a Philosophy class, but just borrows elements of Philosophy to encourage intellectual thinking. I also realize the class would have to be different than many Philosophy classes you can take at various levels of educatuon right now. And perhaps this wouldn't start until 6-7th grade once people are more mature. I still think we could find a way to encourage philosophical type thinking at the beginning grades, but clearly to a different degree than the higher ones."
"The Meaning Of Life: My Analysis And ThoughtsThis is a question that has been asked since humans first became  conscious intelligent beings. It is arguably the most powerful question  in philosophy, and the one that is most often associated with it. There  have been many different answers to this question throughout history.  Different philosophers, scientists and historians have all attempted to  give their unique spin to the question “what is the meaning of life?”.  In today’s post, I am going to examine some of these ideas, break down  the question into smaller pieces, and articulate my own response to this  philosophical inquiry.

**Before we begin this journey, we must first define two important and relevant terms; the concepts “life” and “meaning”.**  

Let’s first look at three definitions for the word “life”:

1. The condition that distinguishes animals and plants  from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,  functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2. The existence of an individual human being or animal.
3. The period between the birth and death of a living thing, especially a human being.

Let’s now look at three definitions for the word “meaning”:

1. What is meant by a concept?
2. What is the significance of a concept?
3. What is the important or worthwhile quality of a concept?

**Now that we have defined both concepts, let’s break things down even further.**

When we are asking “what is the meaning of life?”, we are essentially asking the following 3 questions:

1. What is life?
2. What is life’s significance?
3. How does one live life in the best possible manner?

After having answered these questions, we will be able to synthesize  all of our ideas and create a response to the question that is the  subject of this article.

**What is life?**

As mentioned earlier, life is the condition that distinguishes  animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for  growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change  preceding death.

**Let’s dive deeper into some of these properties.**

1. Organization. Living things are highly organized,  meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living  organisms are made up of one or more cells, which are considered the  fundamental units of life.
2. Metabolism. Living things must use  energy and consume nutrients to carry out the chemical reactions that  sustain life, such as growing, reproducing and maintain the structure of  their bodies.
3. Homeostasis. The maintenance of a stable internal  environment, even in the face of a changing external environment, is  known as homeostasis.
4. Growth. Living organisms undergo regulated growth.
5. Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce themselves to create new organisms.
6. Response: Living organisms show “irritability,” meaning that they respond to stimuli or changes in their environment.
7. Evolution:  Populations of living organisms can undergo evolution, meaning that the  genetic makeup of a population may change over time.

While understanding this list of properties will not greatly affect  our day-to-day framework of how we think and live our lives, it is still  important to know the difference between a living organism and  non-living entity.

**The next question one might have is, how did life begin?**

Many scientists believe that chemical reactions led to RNA, which was  the first molecule on Earth to self-replicate and begin the process of  evolution that led to more advanced forms of life, including human  beings.

**Now that we know how life began in general, let’s examine how life began for human beings.**

Humans evolved from a species known as Homo erectus. Furthermore,  humans share a common ancestor with chimpanzees. For most of our species  history, we were not the dominant force we are today; we were somewhere  in the middle of the animal food chain. Everything changed during the  cognitive revolution that occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago.

We discovered fire, created tools, and developed language. The most  important thing we did was create and connect around ideas that do not  physically exist, such as religion, politics and capitalism. This level  of imagination and consciousness is something that no other living  entity possesses. It is thanks to the cognitive revolution that we are  the dominant, intelligent and conscious beings that we know ourselves to  be today, and it is thanks to our consciousness that we are able to ask  questions such as “what is the meaning of life?”.

**Another big question that we have is the question of how the Universe started.**

The Big Bang theory is the most commonly accepted response to this.

* The Big Band theory is the prevailing cosmological model  explaining the existence of the observable universe form the earliest  known period through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model  describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high  density and temperature.

In recent years, another theory called String theory has gotten quite popular.

* In String theory, the multiverse is a hypothetical group of  multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that  exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and  the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different  universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”, “other  universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”.

We now understand what characteristics separate living organisms from  inorganic matter, how life began, how humans evolved, and why humans  are different from other living organisms. Furthermore, we are able to  somewhat understand what the Universe is and how it started.

**However, we are still left with many questions.**

Are we special? Are we the only intelligent and conscious entities in  the universe or in the multiverse? Is anything “real”, or are we living  in a simulation? Does God exist? Is there life after death? How do all  of the complexities of the Universe work? Is there a deeper purpose to  life or are we merely just bodies of carbon living in a world that is  random and that does not care about us?

Unfortunately, these questions have no objective answers to them. The  deeper we dig, the more questions we have. Science can only answer so  much. There is only so much we can understand about life, about  existence and about the Universe. String theory says that there are 11  dimensions. Humans are only equipped to experience and understand 4 of  those dimensions. With that being said, the progress that we have made  in the last few hundred years has been remarkable. With every year that  passes, we understand a little bit more about the Universe and about  ourselves.

We are curious beings and we are wired to want to explore, to ask  questions, and to try to find answers to the mysteries of the world.

**What is life’s significance?**

As mentioned, we will never know whether we are merely just bodies of  carbon living in a vast apathetic and random Universe, or whether there  is a deeper purpose to our lives and to our existence. With that being  said, life is still meaningful and significant, and the best way to  figure how is to analyze how we are wired as human beings.

Similar to how machines and robots are wired to think and behave in  certain ways, human beings are wired to want and desire certain things.  If there is one thing I want to emphasize in this section, it’s that  while technology and culture have progressed drastically over the last  100 years, we still have the same desires that we had thousands of years  ago and we have not changed much biologically over that time span. The  only difference between today and two thousand years ago is that we are  now satisfying our desires and needs in newer and more complex ways.

**Physical survival.**

Survival is the deepest and most important instinct that we have. As  mentioned earlier in this article, for most of our specie’s history we  were somewhere in the middle of the animal food chain. Without good  health and a good environment, life is difficult and filled with  suffering. No baby is born ready to give up and commit suicide. It takes  a process full of corruption and suffering for a human being to get to  that point. Humans and animals are wired to want to live. As Abraham  Maslow points out in his hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety  needs are the foundation of his pyramid.

While physical survival used to be the act of running from a tiger or  getting shelter in a cave, physical survival today in the western world  is eating healthy, making money, investing, going to the gym, attaining  influence and power, sleeping well, etc.

**Reproduction.**

Reproduction is survival in a different form; survival of our genes  and of our specie. We are wired to want to procreate. Evolution made the  act of sex enjoyable. Our desire for reproduction has not changed.  What’s changed is that as a result of newer technologies, safety and  security, and world dominance, people realize that taking care of  children is a time-consuming lifestyle and choose to focus on their  other needs and goals first, keeping their desire for children as  something to explore later in their lives. Thanks to technological  advancements such as birth control and abortion, people have more  control over their lives and are able to enjoy the benefits of sex  without its consequences.

**Belongingness and Love.**

Humans beings are social animals. We are not meant to live in  isolation. In large part, the way we learn, understand ourselves and the  world, maintain our health and sanity, and think about and solve  problems is by communicating and cooperating with others. There is a  concept that is known as Dunbar’s number. It is essentially a claim that  humans can maintain no more than 150 friendships and connections at a  time. Yuval Noah Harari’s talks about this in detail in his book  “Sapiens”.

Yuval went on to explain that the reason we are able to cooperate in  large groups and dominate the world despite our cognitive limit to the  number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships,  is because of our ability to connect around shares beliefs, such as  stoicism, Christianity, capitalism, money, etc. This shows just how  important connecting with others is for us. In fact, our ability to  communicate and connect with others is one of the biggest reasons how we  went from being in the middle of the animal food chain to the civilized  and dominant people we are today.  

In connection with this desire to connect with others, we are also  wired to want to love and to be loved. Love is crucial for a child’s development. Without adequate love at  an early age during sensitive and critical periods, children develop  attachment issues that can affect them for the rest of their lives. This  shows just how crucial love is for us. Even when we grow up and become  teenagers and adults, we are still yearning for belongingness and love.  It might be something as simple as having anxiety in high school because  we don’t feel as though we have good friends. It might be the  experience of being depressed because a close family member passed away  and we regret not having told them how much we love them. It might be  throwing a fun surprise birthday party for a best friend or sibling  because of how much we cherish them.

Our desire and need to love and to be loved shows itself in numerous  ways throughout our lives. Christopher McCandless wrote this before his  death, “Happiness only real when shared”. This was coming from a man who  had escaped humanity his whole life and who lived his final days in  isolation in the wilderness. Despite pushing people away his entire  life, McCandless realized moments before his death that our lives are  meaningless if we are not surrounded by loved ones.

Another important form of love is self-love. At the end of day, the  only person that will be there with us at every moment of our lives is  ourselves. It is therefore crucial to have a good relationship with  ourselves. If we can’t love ourselves then how can we expect others to  love us? Ayn Rand put this idea beautifully with this quote, “To say ‘I  love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.”

**Curiosity.**

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Europe with  three ships. The explorer and navigator who completed four voyages  across the Atlantic Ocean is known today as one of the most important  figures in history, opening the way for widespread European exploration  and the colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first  European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Christopher Columbus, as well as the thousands of others throughout  history who put their lives at risk for the sake of curiosity and  exploration, did so because they did not want humanity to be forever  bounded by geography and ignorance. The Apollo Lunar Module Eagle  landing on the moon on July 20, 1969 is another example of humankind  attempting to expend its horizons. History is filled with pioneers and  giants from all fields; people like Socrates, Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da  Vinci, Martin Luther King Jr, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,  etc.

Going out of our comfort zones, taking risks, being creative,  expending our horizons, being curious, asking questions, trying new  things, and exploring the earth and space is something that is deeply  ingrained in us. Our desire to explore and to be curious is something  that sets us apart from all other living organisms; it’s what makes us  unique.

Curiosity doesn’t always have to lead to world-changing events like  stepping on the moon or discovering America. Sometimes, curiosity can be  something as simple as sitting down and writing a paper on a topic we  find interesting. Curiosity can be the experience of taking a vacation  and visiting countries and cultures we have never seen. Curiosity can be  the decision to indulge in good habits and to stick to them despite the  discomfort they may cause at first. Curiosity can be the process of  starting a business on an idea we are passionate about. Curiosity is all  around us, and it is one of the most primal instincts that we have.  Let’s embrace our curiosity and our desire for exploration, and let’s  create lives that we will be proud of.  

**Legacy.**

As mentioned earlier, one of the instincts that motivates us the  instinct for survival. We have already talked about two forms of  survival in this article; physical survival and the survival of our  genes and of our specie. There is a third form of survival that controls  much of what we do in life; spiritual survival. Immortality is a desire  that is primal to us. We have the gift of consciousness, but also its  curse. We are the only living organism that is able to imagine and think  about its own death. We don’t want to die. It’s in our nature to desire  survival. For that reason, we try to stay healthy and to physically  survive for as long as can.

However, physical survival is often not enough. We understand  consciously that there will come a time when our bodies will no longer  be able to function. We understand that we will physically die one day.  For that reason, some people turn to religion and God and believe that  if they live a life following certain commandments and behaving in  certain ways, then they will go to heaven and live for eternity. Others  understand that the afterlife is something that we don’t fully  understand. Is there an afterlife? What happens after death? Despite  physical death, will our spirits and souls live on?

These are all pertinent questions. I have the view that there are  certain things that we can’t control. We can’t control what happens to  us after we die. We can control, however, what we do in this life. We  are not guaranteed the promise of heaven. For that reason, we must turn  our attention to building the best legacy we can. Perhaps our name will  be able to live on for generations. Perhaps the value that we will have  given to humankind will play a role in immortalizing our spirit. Perhaps  the legacy we desire is what we leave behind to our children, to our  family, and to our loved ones.

There is a reason that we still remember the names of some of  history’s greatest and most ambitious. There is a reason we still  remember Socrates, his Socratic method of questioning and the honor he  showed in the face of death. There is a reason we still remember Julius  Caesar, the empire he built, and how his empire played a large role in  the development of modern government. There is a reason we remember  Galileo, why we call him the father of observational astronomy, why we  call him the father of the scientific method, and how he stood up for  his beliefs and was a contrarian at a time when going against the grain  could get one killed. There is a reason we will remember Elon Musk long  after he is dead, and his contributions to electric vehicles, space  travel, and clean energy.

The desire for legacy is a great one; there is a lot of meaning that  can be found in its pursuit. The desire for prestige, for  accomplishment, for competition, and for status are some of the most  primal desires that we have. Abraham Maslow, the prominent psychologist  includes esteem needs and self-actualisation as part of his hierarchy of  needs.

It’s important to understand that only a few will be able to have  their names and work immortalized for centuries. Let’s not let that  derail us. It is not the final product that counts. It is the process of  working on something that is greater than ourselves that is of  paramount significance here. In order to build a great legacy, it is  important to help others, to provide value, and to try to push humanity  forward.

Some people will argue that the desire to work towards a great legacy  is stupid. They will argue that one day humans will go extinct and that  when this happens, nobody will know Galileo, Napoleon, Einstein, or  whoever else we want to name. This is a strong logical argument. The  reason I disagree with this view, however, is that logic is not always  the most important factor in an argument. If there’s one thing I want to  make clear in this article, it’s the important of meaning and of  purpose. Where is the meaning in nihilism? Where is the purpose in  believing that we are insignificant and that our lives will mean nothing  millions of years from now?

Despite the fact that these statements may both be logically correct,  what we are trying to articulate in this article is a framework that  will be helpful in our day-to-day lives. A desire for legacy is not only  deeply wired in us, but it is also honorable to want to better  ourselves and to want to better the world. It is honorable to want to  leave behind a piece of who we are, whether in the form of family, in  the form writing, in the form of art, in the form of inventions, in the  form of exploration, or in whatever other medium we choose.

**Acquiring knowledge and transferring it to future generations.**  

If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s the importance of  protecting our species’ knowledge and successfully transferring it  across generations. This goes back to our desire for survival, and more  specifically our desire for the survival of our species. If we do not  safeguard our knowledge, then how can we make sure that the human  species will progress? How can we make sure that we will learn from  history and not commit mistakes that we have committed in the past? We  can’t. It is why books have always been valuable.

Walking in a library is one of the most surreal things that one can  experience. In a library, we have the ability to read from the greatest  minds of human history; Plato, Aristotle, Albert Einstein, Stephen  Hawking, Will Durant, etc. We have more books and more wisdom than can  last a lifetime. Furthermore, our brain is a muscle and it must be  trained. If we spend our days mindlessly scrolling social media and not  putting our brain to use, then we will develop mental problems later in  life and we will not have fulfilled even an ounce of the potential that  we have.

It is our duty to acquire knowledge, to learn as much as we can, and  to put this knowledge into practice. Despite having books and wisdom  from some of the greatest thinkers of all time, our world and our  societies still face many problems. Every era has its own unique set of  problems, and it is our responsibility to learn as much as we can and to  turn our knowledge into practical action. Furthermore, it is our  responsibility transfer our species’ and our personal knowledge to our  kids and future generations so that they will be well equipped to deal  with the challenges of their time.

**Well-being.**

If there is one thing that almost all religions, philosophies, and  schools of thought have in common, it’s that they aim to reduce  suffering and increase well-being.

* Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and  prosperity. It includes having good mental health, high life  satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to manage  stress.

The desires to reduce stress, and to experience happiness and  prosperity are fundamental to who we are. Throughout much of our  species’ history, we experienced wars, diseases, natural catastrophes,  etc. Christopher Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author  wrote the following, “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely  at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history”. This  is a fascinating statistic.

As mentioned earlier, our desires for competition and status, and our  instinct to separate into groups are all part of what makes us human.  Despite all the good that has come from those desires, there has also  been a lot of suffering that has resulted from them. The world can  sometimes be a cruel place filled with evil. It is for this reason that  so many religions and philosophies have attempting to figure out ways in  which we can reduce suffering.

A large part of well-being has to do with health. Gut health, for  example, is strongly correlated with mental health. It is for this  reason that people who have gut problems suffer in life satisfaction. To  be happy, healthy, and to prosper are goals that everyone has. A big  part of making progress towards those goals is combining a lot of the  things that have already talked about in prior sections of this article.  Are we living healthy lives? Are we constantly trying to learn more and  expend our horizons? Do we feel loved and are we surrounded by people  who cherish us? Are we working on our legacies and on projects that  excite us, or are we wasting our time and potential?

Happiness is not something that should be chased. The more we chase  happiness, the more miserable we will be. There is a great book about  this topic called “The Language of Emotions”. It’s important for us to  understand that all emotions are equally important, and that each  emotion serves its own unique purpose. Anger, for example, allows us to  create boundaries. Sadness allows us to release energy. Fear lets us  know when we are in danger. We need to allow happiness to come as a  by-product of a life well-lived, and when it does come, we need let it  be free like a bird; it will come and go when it pleases.

Contentment is a far better thing to aim for. When we are content, we  are grateful for everything that we have. With that being said, we  still try to get a little bit better every day. Mindfulness is also  important. In today’s world of over-stimulation, instant gratification,  and constant comparison, it is easy for us to spend much of our time  either stressing about the future or being depressed about the past.  It’s important to take a step back, to be grateful, and to ask ourselves  what we can do today to better our lives and to create good habits.

Finally, we need to understand that well-being is something that is  unique to each of us. What motivates me and makes me happy, might be  different than what motivates you and makes you happy. It is our  responsibility to have self-awareness, to understand ourselves, and to  understand what drives us.

**How does one live life in the best possible manner?**

Let’s look at what some famous thinkers, philosophies, religions, and schools of thought have said about this.

**Stoicism.**

* Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in  Athens in the early 3rd c entury BC. It is a philosophy of personal  ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural  world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to meaning  and happiness is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,  by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or  by the fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to  do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating  others fairly and justly.

Stoicism was the primary philosophy during the time of the Roman  Empire. The beautiful thing about Stoicism is that arguably the two most  famous Stoics in history came from completely opposing situations and  classes; Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a man who was born  a slave. Despite their complete opposing life situations, both Marcus  Aurelius and Epictetus wrote and talked about all of the same Stoic  virtues. In recent years, Stoicism has had a resurgence. Marcus  Aurelius’ journal “Meditations” is now one of the most famous books in  the world. Furthermore, books from modern writers such as Ryan Holiday  have brought Stoicism into the mainstream.

**Existentialism.**

* Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores  the problem of human existence and centers on the lived experience of  the thinking, feeling, acting individual. In the view of the  existentialist, the individual’s starting point has been called “the  existential angst,” a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or  anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.  Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the  meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were some of the first and most important existentialists.

* Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is  that existence precedes essence, which means that individuals shape  themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived  categories, an “essence”. The actual life of the individuals is what  constitutes what could be called their “true essence” instead of an  arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings,  through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a  meaning to their life.

**Epicureanism.**

* Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BC  based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.  Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable  pleasure in the form of tranquility and freedom from fear, and the  absence of bodily pain through knowledge of the workings of the world  and limiting desires.
* Epicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life.  Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest  amount of pleasure possible during one’s lifetime yet doing so  moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in  such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than  on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially  produced desires were to be suppressed.

**Objectivism.**

* Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by  Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in  her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged  (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books. Rand described  Objectivism as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own  happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement  as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”.

I read a large portion of the book “The Fountainhead” about a year  ago and I enjoyed it. This is one of the passages that has stuck with  me.

* “It is not in the nature of man–nor of any living entity–to start out by  giving up, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that  requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man.  Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run  down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or  how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their  elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning  one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’s values; practicality, of  losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that  fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and  reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek  a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.”

The reason I like this passage so much is because it communicates in  very clear and poetic terms the idea that a desire for meaning and that a  desire for improvement and greatness are core elements of who we are.

**Logotherapy.**

* Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor  Frankl. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the  belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most  powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to  this system is given in Frankl’s most famous book, Man’s Search for  Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his  Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and  reinforced his theories.
* According to Frankl, “We can discover this meaning in life in  three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by  experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude  we take toward unavoidable suffering” and that “everything can be taken  from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose  one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.

**My Thoughts.**

As can be seen, there exists many great schools of thoughts and  philosophies. What almost all of them have in common is the emphasis  they place on pursuing meaning. We live in a world filled with instant  gratification, overstimulation, misinformation, censorship, anxiety and  fearmongering. Furthermore, we live in a world and in an environment  that pedestalizes short-term harmful pleasure and makes it difficult to  delay gratification and pursue meaningful projects and activities. It is  our duty as individuals to take responsibility for our lives, to work  to better ourselves in incremental fashion, to work to better the world,  to try to enjoy the process of life, to love ourselves, and to pursue  meaning rather than short-term detrimental pleasure.

As mentioned earlier in his article, the are many existential and  philosophical questions that we are not able to answer. Perhaps with the  advancement of science we will one day be able to better comprehend the  complexities of the Universe. However, for the time being, we must  focus on what we can control as individuals and create frameworks for  thinking and living that are helpful for our development.

I believe that a large part of the meaning of life is to live  according to our instincts; maintaining good health, being surrounded by  people we love, working on our legacies, acquiring knowledge,  transferring our knowledge across generations, procreating, and placing  great importance on our well-being. However, it’s important to also  understand that we are not chained by our instincts. Each of us have  something special in us that gives us the ability to think and to be  creative. This ability to be flexible, to explore, to try new things, to  learn from great thinkers and philosophers, to go outside of our  comfort zones, to take risk, to go against the grain, to be contrarians,  to be creative, to think outside the box, and to constantly ask  questions and find solutions is what makes us special.

Going back to Viktor Frankl, one of my favorite quotes is the  following, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that  space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our  growth and our freedom.”

I want to emphasize once more that there is meaning in life and that  this meaning can be found all around us. We sometimes see people who  have fallen into nihilism. As someone who once fell into nihilism,  perhaps I can shed some light on my experience and on why nihilism can  be appealing.

* Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that  nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with  extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

The reason I fell into nihilism was because I was going through a  difficult time in my life. I had just moved cities and schools, and I  had left behind all of my childhood friends and almost everything that  was a constant in my life. This happened when I was a young teenager and  it was the worst experience of my life. At the time, I struggled  greatly with understanding my emotions and with social anxiety. It took  many months for me to finally come to terms with my situation and to get  out of denial. For a long time, I tried to convince myself that my  situation was okay and that everything would be alright. I struggled  with anxiety, with depression, and with many more problems.

With that being said, the story has a happy ending; I got closure and  I now live a life where I am generally happy and motivated. My point  with this entire story is that sometimes our life experiences lead us to  philosophies that serve as defence mechanisms. Nihilism, as well as the  belief that free will does not exist, allowed me to tell myself, “life  is meaningless, and I have no control over my situation”. Nihilism was  an escape. The rose-coloured glasses that I had been so accustomed to  wearing had turned into dark-coloured glasses. I was seeing the world  through a completely different lens. When we feel that there is no  meaning in life, it’s probably because something has gone terribly wrong  in our lives.

Of course, this is not always the case. There are plenty of nihilists  out there that believe in nihilism because they believe it to be the  most logical framework for understanding the world. However, as  mentioned earlier in this article, logic is not the only way to go about  looking for truth and examining topics such as the meaning of life;  emotions and instincts are sometimes just as important. An obsession  with logic leads to skepticism. David Hume demonstrated this with “the  problem of induction”. The problem of induction essentially explains  that nothing in the Universe can be proven for certainty. The problem of  induction, as mind-boggling as it is, demonstrates that the odds of the  sun rising tomorrow are equal to the odds of the sun not rising  tomorrow. That is the problem when we put logic on a pedestal and don’t  consider other important factors.

Nihilism is not natural because it looks at the world through a  pessimistic and defeatist lens, which is antithetical to how we are  wired and to who we are as human beings. No baby is born a nihilist.  Going back to Ayn Rand’s quote, “It is not in the nature of man–nor of  any living entity–to start out by giving up, by spitting in one’s own  face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose  rapidity differs from man to man.”

With closure, with life experiences, with the process of slowly  improving, with information on how to deal with grief, and with  knowledge on life and existence, I went from being a nihilist to the  person I am today, the person I have always truly been; someone who  looks at the world with a glass half-full, someone who looks at the  world with curiosity, wonder and love, and someone who believes in  meaning, pursues meaning, and lives a life of meaning.

To further emphasize my point that life has meaning, and that  striving for meaning is natural and a core part of who we are, let’s  look at the science. Psychologist Jordan Peterson talks about the  orienting reflex in many of his lectures online. He explains that our  brain produces a very complex internal model of the world, and that our  senses produce a model of the external world. The hippocampus watches  those two models to see if they match, and if they don’t match, then a  mismatch signal is created; the orienting reflex.

* The orienting reflex is an organism’s immediate response to a  change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to  elicit the startle reflex. The orienting reflex is a reaction to novel  or significant stimuli.

The orienting reflex essentially serves as a compass of meaning for  us; it is an instrument that guides us through life. It is one of the  deepest instincts that we have. The best way to articulate this point is  by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, M. J. DeMarco:

* “Your soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced  with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or  during a massage. How are you responding to your soul’s voice? Is it  denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work?  Distracted by a television? Honored?”

When we are wasting time and when we are indulging in behaviours and  activities that lack meaning, that are unnatural, and that are  antithetical to growth, our orienting reflex will let us know. It is our  responsibility to listen to our voice, to accept the mistakes that  we’ve made, and to take steps towards the right direction. Life is  filled with meaning. We must open our eyes and we must embrace this  meaning. Meaning is a core part of who we are, and we must live in  accordance to the instincts and purposes that have been explained and  analyzed in this article. Furthermore, we must also not follow  philosophies and ideas blindly and dogmatically, and we must understand  that the journey of life and the journey of meaning is unique to each of  us.

This article was a collection of thoughts from some of the greatest  thinkers of all time, as well as my own thoughts and my attempt to  synthesize all of this information. It is worth noting that someone  might read this article and not agree with everything. That is okay, and  it is completely normal. Each of us are at a different stage in our  process of life, and we come from different environments and have  different genetics. Despite the objective nature of some of these ideas,  the way I view life and the way you view life will not always be the  same. Two of the most important skills one can have are self-awareness  and critical thinking. If we are able to understand ourselves and our  thought process, and if we are able to question ourselves and to  question the world, then we have what it takes to grow as human beings  and to tackle difficult questions such as “what is the meaning of life?

Best of luck my fellow readers. Please feel free to reach out to me to ask any questions or to discuss some of these ideas!"
"Being Conscious## Being Conscious

Questions about the relationship between mind and matter seem to give you the following options:

    A. mind comes from matter 
         - or - 
    B. matter comes from mind 
         - or - 
    C. mind and matter have some kind of dual arrangement

Given these options, we seem most likely to choose option A, mind comes from matter. Most of the things matter can do, we can understand with scientific theories; which just means we usually have a material explanation for the things matter does. So if mind comes from matter, what is the material explanation for our conscious experience? That's a [Hard Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) indeed.

We began by asking what the relationship is between mind and matter. We should take it a step deeper. What is the relationship between mind and being? This might seem like a rather vague and meaningless question and something that a rational person would not spend much time thinking about. But, I have, and I'm going to report my findings for the sake of philosophical discussion.

#### Questions about Being

What is being? What is a being? Generally when you say ""a being"" to someone, they think about some kind of animal with a brain. Perhaps they think of insects and even plants as beings as well.

Is that it? Is that all? Are living beings the only kind of beings there are? 

Let's take a human being, which is, as far as we know, a large compound of atoms. A biological machine with a brain. And that's generally it. If you're the only living being in a room, are you surrounded by non-being? What makes the distinction between being and non-being? We don't use ""soul"" anymore to distinguish from beings and non-beings. Though we do seem to use intelligence. Or perhaps consciousness.

When we look at the Moon, we know it's a big rock orbiting Earth. Now I'm not suggesting the Moon is a living being. I'm not suggesting the Moon has a mind or is conscious. However, I asked myself, is the Moon non-being? Is the Earth non-being? 

If so, did being simply arise from non-being? I'm not questioning abiogensis either (although alternatives are fun to think about) which says that life emerged from non-life. It could be that living beings arose from non-living beings, or they arose from non-living non-beings. (If only lifeforms can be considered to have being, then the latter would have to be true.)

But is that the right way to think about being? If the Moon is non-being, why does it seem to ""be"" there. If the Moon is non-being, why does it exist? If nothing was being the Moon, why do I see it? Are these just silly word games? Had I fallen into a bottomless rabbit hole?

#### Answers about Being

I am alone in a room typing on this laptop. Two options:

    A. the room is non-being, except for me 
         - or - 
    B. the room is being, including me

I may have implicitly accepted option A my whole life. But where does option B lead? It leads to the conclusion that the Moon is being the Moon, the Earth is being the Earth, the stars are being the stars, the clouds and the rain are being themselves too. Not necessarily living beings, just part of being in general. Being existed before life. Being is existence. You are not just a being; you are part of being-itself. 

#### Being and Matter

The simplest way to look at it is that all matter is existing, so all matter is being. And some of that matter happens to be your body, some of which is your skull, some of which is your brain, some of which are neurons. The notion is somehow this leads to a conscious experience, and why that is, as previously noted, is a Hard Problem. But what other reasonable way is there to look at it? Matter has to be the basis of being-itself, the thinking goes, because if it were not particles of matter being the Sun, then what else would be being the Sun? Here are again some options:

    A. matter is primary 
         - or - 
    B. matter is made of something else

Option A again seems to be the most obvious and likely answer, because if matter is made of something, wouldn't that something have to be made of matter? 

The problem here is the unstated assumption that there is only one kind of matter. There are in fact [two kinds of matter](http://mazehatter.com/matter.htm):

    1. pre-measurement matter 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter

and they are fundamentally distinct. We have seen it in Everett's [""Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics""](http://mazehatter.com/everett.htm), and in the most eminent philosophers throughout history. 

In quantum mechanics, pre-measurement matter is typically represented as a wavefunction of many possibilities. In Hugh Everett's formulation, the wavefunction never ceases to exist, however, the memory of an observer contains the result of a measurement following interactions with its sensors. That is to say, post-measurement matter exists according to the information in an observer's memory, and pre-measurement matter is the information that defines a wavefunction wherein there exists an observer with senses and memory.

In this case, our options can be rewritten as two compatible postulates:

    1. pre-measurement matter is primary 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter is made of measurements

Likewise, with two kinds of matter, it no longer makes sense to ask if:

    a. mind comes from matter 
         - or - 
    b. matter comes from mind

But instead it should be clarified to which kind of matter does the question refer? These two options could actually be interpreted as four options. Does:

    a. mind comes from pre-measurement matter 
         - or - 
    b. mind comes from post-measurement matter 
         - or - 
    c. pre-measurement matter comes from mind 
         - or - 
    d. post-measurement matter comes from mind
         
At this point, recall that in Everett's formulation, there is an observer treated within the theory as a system that has a memory and senses interacting with the other systems, and this is taken to be an observer that makes measurements. The arrangement is therefore:

    1. the observer comes from pre-measurement matter

    2. post-measurement matter comes from the observer and its measurement records

It is sometimes suggested (not often by physicists) that quantum mechanics requires consciousness, and this suggestion is rebutted (often by physicists) as being a load of baloney. Accordingly, I'm not suggesting that measurement in quantum mechanics requires consciousness or mind. I would however be fairly willing to bet the opposite is true, that a scientific theory of mind requires a scientific theory of measurement. 

#### Being and Mind

The Hard Problem is helpfully thought of in terms of philosophical zombies. If we made a robot, that had all the same sensors as we have, all the same neurons and connections as we have, would the robot necessarily have a conscious experience? Would it truly experience colors and sounds?

Without the concept of being, the idea of a philosophical zombie seems fairly straightforward. Sure, we aren't talking about the robot zombie's soul, because nobody that believes themselves to be scientific also believes in a literal soul. Yet at the same time, this idea of consciousness being something that could be put in or taken out of a material body seems to be very much like the soul. This optional quality of consciousness determines whether they are a real being or soul-less machine.

But when you introduce a wider concept of being, it's not something you can put in or take out of material. Just as a star is being a star, and the Earth is being the Earth, and a human body is being a human body, then even robots are real beings. Yes, you may say, but are they conscious beings? If the robot has the same neural systems as we do, which is true in the case of philosophical zombies, then some part of being-itself is being the output of the robot's neural network, which is a dynamic model of existence composed of a rich and integrated set of measurements, also known as the conscious experience, consciousness, or mind.

Consciousness is often thought of something possessed by an individual, but something important about looking at it from this angle is remincent of the words of Carl Sagan, that we are how the Cosmos explores itself. The remarkable aspect of consciousness or even plain measurement, is not that you and I can do it, but that existence and thus being-itself has knowledge of itself when a measurement is performed.

#### Conclusion

Two kinds of matter exist, pre-measurement and post-measurement. The mind is an observer that makes an extremely rich set of measurements. Therefore, the relationship between mind and matter is:

    1. mind comes from pre-measurement matter 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter comes from mind

And so it turns out that in the philosophy of the mind, the Realists and Idealists are both right (but both incomplete). 

An often suggested solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness is the set of information produced by our brains. Many people feel this explanation is missing something. I think what it is missing is *being*, the idea that we are parts of being-itself, and that something must *be* everything, including the information it has about itself, and that is why we have consciousness."

The only way out is through. Global society is dependent on artificially inflated energy resources—i.e. oil—that are directly leading us toward total collapse. Technology is being used to most efficiently maximize wealth of the largest corporate conglomerates at the expense of the social fabric and a living environment. The biosphere is in fact collapsing. The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

[iv] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"Asimov's Three LawsI was thinking about Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, which are as follows for those who don't know:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

I have ethical problems with the first and the third laws, and wanted to get Reddit's opinion/wisdom on the matter.

Concerning the first law, what if a situation arose where the robot had two choices, both of which involved harming humans? For instance let's take that old ethical problem (I may not have the details exactly right, but the principle is the same): There's a train, with no brakes, rolling down the tracks towards a large group of people. You're steering the train. You can either move the train to the side, killing a lone, innocent person, or not do anything and allow the train to kill multiple innocent people. What would the robot, following the Three Laws, do if it were steering the train? If he doesn't make a decision or decides not to change the train's course (effectively the same thing), he kills more people than if he takes action and steers the train (only killing one person). If you amended the law to say, ""if forced to react to a situation where the only choices, as well as inaction, caused harm to humans, kill as few as possible"", isn't that a utilitarian point of view? I personally agree with this, but many humans would disagree (they're the ones who would choose to let the train stay on its course). How do we decide what the robot is to do?

Concerning the third law, my problem is: why should we force robot to continue being in existence? If robots somehow developed the thought capacity to question their own existence, and choose not to continue living, then wouldn't forcing them to obey this law be cruel? Or would this law automatically force robots to desire to continue living as long as possible (their programming wouldn't allow them to have suicidal thoughts). If so is that unfair? What if they developed the capacity for pain - would the law still be just if they could feel pain? In questioning this law I also find that the second law is unjust if robots gained this level of consciousness (robots would effectively be forced into slavery). So i guess my question becomes: do the three laws limit the capacity of thought a robot could have? And is this fair?

Sorry this is a little stream of consciousness-ish. For those of you lazy bums:

TL;DR: When considering the first law, what should a robot do if forced into a situation that will harm humans no matter what choice is made (or isn't made). And do the second two laws limit the capacity of thought robots can have, and if so is it fair for humans to put a cap on the intelligence of other life forms?"
"Where is AI's place in society?A few months back I saw an article here about a study where kids would interact with an ""intelligent robot"" then discuss their thoughts about him being locked in a closet.  While the robot was controlled by a human in the end, most kids decided it wasn't fair that the robot should be locked up.  This got me thinking about Artificial intelligence's place in society and where their ""rights"" should begin and end.  Is it okay to lock a robot in a closet or have they become too human for that already?  If not, then when, if at all?  any thoughts?"
"Ethics in a Post Apocalyptic Setting - A What-If Scenario for Fun!I'm reposting this from /r/gaming because I'm curious how /r/philosphy redditors would answer this in their own subreddit. 

I've played Fallout: New Vegas a number of times now, and I love how many moral choices you're presented with throughout. However, I've noticed myself doing a lot of meta-gaming when it came to how I solved problems. I think this is natural and a lot of people playing a game want to make the decision that ultimately helps them the most (gets them items, money, xp). Whatever role playing they may have considered when creating their character is basically out the window when making decisions of this nature. 

I would like to attempt a pure role playing play-through of New Vegas, but I think it would help a lot to establish what kind of behaviors I'm allowed prior to beginning so I don't have to make shit up as I go along. Much as our society (the Old World) has a moral code of what most people find acceptable behavior, so must a setting like New Vegas. However, these are not always going to match up with Old World values for obvious reasons. Example, if today you found a dead body in the middle of the street, it would not be proper to loot the dead body. It would be considered tampering with a crime scene, etc... However, if placed in a post-apocalyptic world of radiation, starvation, and roaming gangs of violent criminals being *the norm*, I'm pretty sure you or I would not bat an eye at rifling through the deceased's belongings.

So, now that you know what I'm talking about, lets come up with some fairly universal rules of acceptable behavior for survivors wandering the Mojave desert. Forget what the game rewards Karma for, we're not trying to make a saint, we're trying to describe basic practices accepted as necessary for survival. I'll start!

**A)** Responding to any threat of violence with violence is acceptable (there is no public justice system in place to punish someone for assault, rape, or murder)

**B)** Shooting first (sneak attack) when a threat is implied (wild animals, raiders, killer robots) is acceptable 

**C)** Taking anything with no obvious owner (shop keeper, etc...) is acceptable

These are the easy and obvious rules, pre-requisites to basic survival in the Mojave and New Vegas. The bigger questions that need addressed are things like, is Caesar's Legion right? Why? Is it really better to be independent (Yes Man path) or does humanity's best hope of survival actually lie in joining the New California Republic? Or, since Mr. House saved New Vegas during the final hours of the Old World, does he deserve to continue to rule it? Consider these questions from a wasteland ethics perspective and how that would answer them, not your own personal ethics.

Let us get into this!

Other example areas of discussion:

Is there value in salvaging Old World tech, or would this eventually lead to a repetition of what destroyed the Old World? (this is the Brotherhood of Steel perspective)

Now that all governments have been destroyed, is this an opportunity for humanity to continue without them (anarchy / ultra-libertarianism)? Or should a formal government like the NCR be re-established as quickly as possible?"
"Can killing in the name of good be justified when innocents may also be harmed?During a sleepless night, I typed this out. It is a description of my internal conflict with being a contracted hacker for the government and the morality of my actions. 

**Background Info:**
I am 17. I work for a network security company that does contracting for the government. My work involves gaining access to a specific target using vulnerabilities in consumer devices. Since I do not a have a clearance I am given no information about the target.

**Start:**
I want to know I’m doing the right thing. Because what I do makes me a killer. Not directly, but ultimately what I do may or may not end someone else’s life. Work that I do with law enforcement can put a pedophile behind bars or work with the military can put a bullet through someone’s head in Afghanistan. It wasn’t like this before. Before, it was just the excitement of solving the puzzle, finding that one flaw that would give you unauthorized access. It didn’t feel quite real, at least not until the sudden realization that what I am doing actually affects people’s lives. The realization changes the “I just bypassed the security on that webcam” to “I just got a visual id on the target.” It’s been some months since I realized this and now I can’t stop asking myself the question: “Am I doing the right thing?” 

Personally, I do not believe that our government always makes the right decisions. Our elected officials are people just like us and are likely to make decisions that further their own agenda rather than do the “right” thing. Most of the time, there is no consensus on what the right thing is. There is so much conflict within the government that I cannot believe that without a doubt, the actions it makes are completely justified. What I do to help it can either be good or evil. Did hacking into some foreign computer network help the military kill someone? Maybe. Was he a terrorist? Who knows. I’d like to think that by providing the military with more information, I make it less likely for them to make a mistake, but I can’t be certain of that and I can’t be certain that the target deserved to die. 

So how do I justify my actions to help an entity that punishes people when my faith in its ability to do so fairly is lacking? I have to assume that it makes the correct decisions. I need to tell myself that when my software breaks into someone’s home network, that I am helping society by removing those who cause harm. I tell myself that each network I break into means that there is some little kid won’t be hurt. That one girl won’t have to live the rest of her life in silence and shame because she is scared to speak out. I pray that my work isn’t being abused to help spy on those who are innocent or worse, kill those who are innocent. It’s a huge burden that I place on a single assumption.  

I need to feel verification that I have done the right thing, that even if someone was harmed because of me, it was worth it because many more avoiding suffering. This need makes the words people that say to me have so much more meaning than they intend. Acceptance by others is verification that I have done the right thing while rejection proves that I have made a mistake. Hearing someone say that they trust me puts me in a blissful happiness. On the other hand, the words, “You’re not the right one for me. I just want to be friends” becomes a soul-crushing “You had good intentions, but you have made a terrible mistake and I can’t accept that.” Being aware of my unwarranted translation does nothing to mitigate the feelings it stirs up. I vividly remember a breakup where I was told, “I feel like you are using your depression to take advantage of me.” The shock that put through me was enormous. I had been able to feel like I was doing the right thing by demonizing rapists, pedophiles, generally anyone who takes advantage of others for sex. Now, to be heard that I was one, completely ripped my mind apart. Someone that I cared for did not want to be with me because she thought I was one of them. The rest of the day was spent contemplating quick and painless ways of suicide while a friend ineffectively tried to convince me that it wasn’t true. Honestly, the only thing that saved me was probably the fact that I felt so useless that I couldn’t bring myself to do anything.

Dealing with people has an extra level of difficulty, especially with people who don’t quite understand what I do. It seems that whenever people at school talk about me, the subject is always how much money I make. I have even had several people I do not normally talk to come up to me and inquire about my yearly salary. One such person even friend requested me on Facebook shortly after asking. This question disgusts me. My work decides if people live or die and people’s main concern is gossiping over how much money I make? Is only my pay important? How about catching those pedophiles, is that important? Is it worth the damage I might cause? Am I causing other people’s deaths for the money? I hope not. Just the idea of it sickens me. So I started using a large portion of my paycheck to buy toys for kids in hospitals. I remember when I was learning to program, my brother was in the hospital. The everyday before visiting him, I would frantically be programming a game to let him play on my laptop when I went to visit. He was so excited when he got to play my simple board game. I hope the money I got from my gamble at least brings a smile to others like the one my brother had. At least this helps me hold on to what sanity I have, but the toll this conflict is having on me is becoming more apparent.

I go through most days robotically. I wake up in the morning, go to school, go to work, go home, pass out, then stay up all through the night. Why? Sleep is a curse. I only sleep when my body can no longer handle being awake any longer since my dreams are painful. Some nights I dream of being punished for the fates I’ve brought to others, some nights I dream that I can no longer handle it and kill the ones I know who are guilty, and some nights I dream I am back in the asylum where I belong. If I am lucky, I don’t dream. I am in a different state of mind every day. I may go a few days feeling on top of the world while, on other days, I feel wretched and useless. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone. I can’t stand being unable to control my thoughts and feelings. I can’t help but let my personal relationships be intertwined with my conscience. My aim has always been to protect those who cannot protect themselves and spread happiness to those who suffer. The constant conflict in my mind leaves me lost and confused. I am sorry to those around me that I hurt because I am blind and those who I do not know because I am mistaken. Am I doing the right thing? Did I make the right choice?"
"Anthropic reasoning questionConsider a drone that is being shot at with a missile. It appears reasonable to write drone software so that in the event of survival it would decrease it's estimate of missile's effectiveness, in the precisely same well understood manner as if the missile would say ""bang, you're dead"" instead of destroying the drone. It doesn't matter that the on-board computer would not exist if it had been destroyed and wouldn't conclude anything. Simply not a part of calculation. 

Now, this is pretty similar to John Leslie's Firing Squad analogy, except instead of the human I have a drone which I can program arbitrarily. I effectively argue that in Leslie's Firing Squad, the evidence is to be processed in same manner as if the nerf guns were used.

I'm arguing with some amateur philosopher who seems convinced that this reasoning is ""crazy"" for a human observer (even though he does not believe in soul or the like). I'm myself an applied mathematician and this one is a fairly straightforward problem for design of any sort of robotic drone (Matter of fact I have written game AIs, and everyone routinely assumes that if the program is still running this is evidence that the user has not deliberately exited it). The probabilistic calculations in question are quite straightforward, and are utterly commonplace in all sorts of hardware self-test scenarios. My understanding is that anthropic bias is a much subtler issue arising in different types of probabilistic equations. 

I vaguely recall a variety of anthropic principle that coincides with the reasoning of the drone in my example (and I know philosophers tend to very thoroughly consider such cases), but the name of that variation evades me. Can someone help me with that?"
"My friend and I exchange philosophical epistles to stay in touch.This one is ""On Evil""I’ve decided to write to you today, to discuss something that has been weighing quite heavily on my mind. I won’t pretend to be doing so with selfless motives; I enjoy this sort of talk, and I always jump at the chance to hone my writing abilities.

Since I have just spoken of “honing my writing abilities”, I will not allow myself an irresponsibly decorated introduction.

I am writing to you, dear friend, to discuss the Argument of Evil, and while I am well aware that you know the details of this argument, I will still summarize it in my own colloquial words. 

The world is full of murderers, rapists, liars, and villains of all sorts. Innocent children are murdered every year. People experience sorrow and pain of unfathomable intensity on a daily basis all throughout the world, and throughout the history of life itself. 
If someone COULD prevent such horror, especially at no cost to themselves, they would have the highest moral obligation to do so.  If someone cannot prevent these tragedies, then that person is not omnipotent.
If a god exists, then he is either impotent or evil.

This is the basic argument you will hear brought against the notion of god(or at least a benevolent god). My intention in this letter is not to defend the argument from evil, but rather to express my dissatisfaction with the best theological objections to it. 

It is so easy to allow emotion to commandeer ones faculties, and cause one to forsake clarity of thought, so I will try my best to avoid this perennial pitfall.

In my younger years, I never gave this argument much credit. I could dismiss it easily in a number of ways. As I aged, and I became exposed to the philosophies of academic Christians, my arsenal of responses to the problem of evil steadily increased. For the sake of convenience I will list the most common responses to the problem of evil below.

1.) Bad things happen to allow good things to come of them. I.E. ""When God closes one door he opens another"".

2.) God works in mysterious ways. (""We can't possibly understand why God does the things he does so let's just assume they are good"") This relates to the first argument but is slightly different.

3.) Bad things happen to remind us that we are sinful and must worship God. (""God made 9-11 happen to punish America for sinfulness"") A famous accusation of the late and not great Jerry Falwell.

- This next one is far and above the most sophisticated-

4.) God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

- The first argument can be discarded merely because of it’s blatant appeal to the future, and the third can be ignored because of its downright barbarism, as well as its inconsistency(Since it would require all non-Christian countries to suffer God’s wrath). 

The second and the fourth, however, have some value. 

The 2nd argument is obviously an appeal to ignorance, and yet I will give it a proper response because of it’s frequent use by noted apologists. I read an essay by the eminent Christian philosopher William Lane Craig on the problem of evil, and after suffering through his trademark wordiness, I saw that he was unable to avoid this appeal to ignorance.

He explain that as “finite, limited beings” we cannot possibly fathom the timeless, infinite God of the universe.

Forget, for a moment, how irritating this common religious response is, and look at it through the lense of your greatest ally; Reason. 

In general, the Christian responses to the argument from evil are always arguments of unavoidable victory. This means that they frame things in such a way so that if something good happens, it is God’s doing. However when something terrible happens, it is attributed to the mystery of God, or perhaps even the mischief of Old Nick. Victory is unavoidable.

This sort of thought reminds me of a passage from Voltaire’s Candide, which I will provide below.

“You see,” said Candide to Martin, “that crime is sometimes punished; that rascal of a Dutch captain met the fate he deserved.”
“Yes”, said Martin, “but was it necessary that the passengers on his ship should perish also? God punished that knave, the devil drowned the others”

Voltaire, with his merciless wit, rightly mocks this sort of childish thought. The idea that all good things are attributed to God, and all bad things find ownership elsewhere, is embarrassingly transparent and should not be given a second thought by the intellectually honest thinker.
 
We now move on to the most compelling rebuttal to the argument from evil, the 4th argument.

God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

I first heard this argument put forth by prominent Cambridge mathematician and apologist John Lennox. Lennox has been referred to as the “closest thing to a modern C.S. Lewis”, and is a rare example of a respected Christian Scientist( A Christian who is a scientist, not the outrageous hallucinations of Mary Baker Eddy). He used the 4th argument in a debate with Christopher Hitchens, and I felt as though his argument was not properly scrutinized. Here is the link to their debate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH68Y5MUGfo

The reason Lennox’s argument went uncontested is because Hitchen’s actually shares this belief. In Hitchens' book Letters to a Young Contrarian, he attacks the idea of universal accord, and states that disagreement is what makes life worth living. He explains how dull and meaningless a world would be where there is no contrary thought or competing ideas. Hitchens didn’t think to contest Lennox’s argument because he holds the same belief. This, I believe, caused him to miss the problem with Lennox’s idea.

If you haven’t seen the glaring contradiction in Lennox’s argument yet, I will not delay any longer in revealing it to you. 

Lennox claims that a world without any pain, or any disagreement, would be a robotic world in which love, peace, and happiness mean nothing. That without their opposites they have no definition. The problem is that the Christian doctrine idealizes this very type of world in the concept of heaven. Christians yearn for an Eternal Paradise where there is no sorrow or suffering. They “take no thought for the morrow” because Christ will undoubtedly return in their lifetimes. To Christians, this life is simply passing scenery on the path to paradise. The core Christian belief in heaven directly contradicts the 4th argument. 

I happen to agree that a Nirvana of this sort is as inconceivable as it is undesirable. A place where all people share the same opinions, and dissension is nowhere to be found, is not a place that I would want to exist in even if it were a possibility. It would be robotic, unconscious, and inhuman.

The problem for Christians is that the Bible does not agree with this sentiment, and so the 4th argument cannot be used by those Bible believing Christians who so love to use it.

The notion of heaven is the key to dismantling the 4th argument.

I am an agnostic who is quite friendly to the idea of Deism, and so I am not entirely convinced by the argument of evil. I look forward to hearing your thoughts dear friend, and I hope they will bring some clarity to this most difficult topic. 

Warmest regards to you and your family.

How to Build a Moral Robot

"No Crime Deserves Punishment – A Proof Against “Moral Responsibility”I make no claims about the nature of reality. Let's clear our assumptions about reality and start with a blank canvas and arrive ""a priori"" to the conclusion “**No Crime Deserves Punishment**”. Note that I will be redefining what I mean by these terms, I will not implicitly overload them.

First, some definitions:

Consider two classes of things:

Class 1: Things for which there is a conscious awareness of

Class 2: Things for which there is no conscious awareness of

Things in Class 1 are things like thoughts, emotions, feelings, desires, sensations, memories, sights, sounds, etc. Let's name these things “conscious objects”.

Things in Class 2 may or may not exist. Let's name these things “unconscious objects”.

Mere witnessing: the act of observing a thing without interacting with it

Consciousness: the ""mere witnessing"" of conscious objects as they arise in the present moment

Punishment: the infliction of “suffering” (a conscious object) upon a consciousness

Crime: some class of conscious objects


And now the premises of my argument:

P1) The “mere witnessing” of a “conscious object” does not “cause” nor change that conscious object, nor any other conscious objects

P2) A is “responsible” for B, if A directly or indirectly “caused” B, eventually

P3) A “deserves punishment” for B, if A is “responsible” for B, and B is a “crime”


With me so far? If you accept the above premises, we can continue:

P4) By P1, consciousness does not cause nor change any conscious objects that arise

~~P5) It follows from its definition that consciousness does not cause nor change any unconscious objects~~

~~P6) By P4 and P5, consciousness does not cause or change anything~~

P7) By P2 and P4, consciousness is not “responsible” for any conscious objects

P8) By P3 and P7, consciousness does not “deserve punishment” for conscious objects

P9) Since “punishment”, by definition, can only be inflicted on a “consciousness”, then it follows from P8 that nothing deserves punishment for conscious objects

P10) By P9, and since a crime is a conscious object, No Crime Deserves Punishment


**tl;dr No Crime Deserves Punishment**

EDITED:

There seems to be people who want to assert that ""this is not what anyone means by punishment"". Here is my rebuttal:

Why did I define punishment this way? Because I am alluding to such notions of punishment as:

- inflicting harm to those who have wronged you

- taking vengeance upon ""evil-doers""

- delivering justice to those who ""deserve it""

- being sent to an eternity in hell for being sinful

- torturing the evil

- the death penalty for murderers

- deciding a person's prison sentence based on how much they ""deserve to be punished"" and hence ""how long they should suffer for"" AS OPPOSED TO other reasons such as isolating them TO PROTECT society, or acting as DETERRENT for other crime, REHABILITATION, etc. (All of the latter causes are noble because they seek to benefit CONSCIOUS BEINGS, even taking into account the very conscious being that is sent to prison too).

All of the above kinds of ""punishment"" only make sense in the context of a conscious being. Why is it okay to step on grass, yet not okay to step on a puppy?

Can you torture a rock? Can you inflict suffering on a robot that it can truly feel? Can you harm in any meaningful way a philosophical zombie?

No. You need consciousness for that. So the ONLY thing that you can punish is consciousness; I defined it in this way to deliberately target the irrational kinds of ""justice"" some people seem to value as listed above. And the only reason they value this is because they believe that they ""deserve it"". My argument is here to refute that: no consciousness deserves to suffer, for how can a mere witness deserve anything? Consciousness is the poor victim caught up in some other realm's games of morality and justice."
"West World does a beautiful job illustrating a classic philosophical problem: does an absence of freewill preclude moral responsibility for an act? [Potential spoilers but I'll try to keep it general]HBO's series West World is about an old-west theme park filled with extremely lifelike androids where real people can come to the park and play any role they like, good, evil, or otherwise.   
  
A few episodes into the season, it's revealed that one android relives the same narrative every night. In it, she comes home to find her parents being murdered, and unfortunately for her, after discovering the grizzly scene, the gang that's killed her family violently rapes her in a barn. It's a horrible fate, but remember, it's a game, she's a robot, and ostensibly, the only emotional damage one need worry about is that of the theme park's real guests who witness this atrocity (or as you'll see, participate in it).   
  
Because of the nature of this game, this storyline isn't set in stone. Sometimes, a real person might be riding with the gang and after murdering the family and grabbing the poor daughter robot, they offer her up to the guest. This person has the choice: do I rape this innocent girl robot or not? But if they decline, she's not spared. One of the gang members takes her to the barn and rapes her anyway. This happens every single night.  
   
This situation illustrates beautifully a classic moral question of free will and moral responsibility.   
  
Let's begin with the gang member robot that rapes the daughter robot if the guest declines to do so. He's programmed to play out this storyline. His role as rapist is no more his choice than her role as rape victim is her choice. Their parts are determined by the park's story writers, and they both play them out every single night, like it or not.  
  
But what about the guests that sometimes ride with the posse of raping murderers? They're real people, and for the sake of argument let's say they have free will. They choose whether or not to rape the daughter robot. Sometimes, they choose to do so.  
  
In both cases, the result is the same: the poor girl who just came across her family's murder ends up being raped in a barn.  
  
Again, for the sake of argument, let's say that moral judgements are both real and objectively true, and that killing a girl's whole family and raping her are morally reprehensible acts. This brings up two important points.  
  
First, the nature of this morally reprehensible act necessarily requires two parties: a victim and a perpetrator. In the case of the real person that chooses whether or not to rape the girl, it's clear that that person is the actor in the crime. The moral responsibility for it then falls on them.  
  
Now consider the second case, that of the robot programmed to rape the girl if the guest declines. Is that robot morally responsible? We've established that this act requires both a victim and a perpetrator, and this rapist robot is clearly the one that performs the act of rape on the innocent daughter robot. His actions are identical to that of the real person who is definitely morally responsible. His actions are willful, though they may not be free.  
  
Furthermore, he doesn't know that his actions are determined. As far as he knows, he's acting according to his own free will. The only difference between his actions and the actions of the park guest that chooses to rape her is the fact that he is programmed to do so, which requires an objective knowledge of the situation.   
  
So to summarize: we're claiming that the act of raping the daughter robot is always morally reprehensible. In no case is it a morally acceptable behavior. In one case, a real person chooses whether or not to do it, and in the other case, a robot programmed to do so carries it out. But in both cases, someone rapes the daughter robot, and bears the moral responsibility of doing so.  
  
Do we want to say that the robot that rapes the daughter robot is less morally responsible for his actions because he cannot control them? This robot rapes her almost every night -- many nights there are no guests with the gang, and some nights the guests decline to rape her, so without question the rapist robot does most of the raping. Does his lack of free will exclude him from the countless rapes he has perpetrated against this girl robot?   

It's been a while since I've studied ethics, so please, if someone has supporting literature about these topics, chime in below. I just found this example to be an interesting illustration of a question I remember from undergrad.

Just War and Robots’ Killings
"Morality apart from Theism?This seems to be a hot button issue in a lot of discussions and I'm curious to hear thoughts. Specifically, I am looking for a cogent argument in favor of the existence of objective morality in a naturalistic framework. 

Point of clarification: I don't want to discuss the morality of any specific RELIGION. I don't think objections to the specific moral claims of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc have a place here. Rather, I want to discuss whether belief in objective moral values is warranted (of if such values can even exist) unless a supreme being (or beings) provides them under some form of a divine command. 

My Argument: I do not believe that an objective morality, that is, moral values that transcend human preference, is possible apart from God. If God does not exist, then human beings are, to quote Dawkins, ""survival machines, robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes."" (The Selfish Gene) This means that our ability to perceive moral values is a mere byproduct of our genes' propensity to pass on their genetic material. At best, we can only say that these perceptions are (or were at one time in the past) useful in allowing humans to reproduce. But this does not point to an objective morality, but only a functional morality, where what is ""moral"" is only that which allows us to better pass on our genes to the next generation.

Sam Harris has tried in *The Moral Landscape* to offer a scientistic framework for objective moral values, by equating ""evil"" to ""suffering"" and that we should define good as ""that which supports the well-being of conscious creatures."" (The Moral Landscape)

But I find his argument extremely lacking. All he is arguing is that the ""well-being of conscious creatures"" is desirable, and that the suffering of the same is undesirable. But this again points to a functional morality, not an objective one. Under naturalism, there is no reason to attach any moral value to individual well-being or suffering, but only to that of the species as a whole. So what is to stop us from reinstating policies of eugenics to further the human race?

Anyway, I'm gonna start rambling if I don't stop. I look forward to hearing your views!"
Eric Schwitzgebel on two arguments for AI/Robot rights. [The Splintered Mind]
"Moral motivation and moral realismI originally posted this in /r/askphilosophy, but it got almost no attention there, so I'm reposting it in /r/philosophy to hopefully get a larger audience.  I mainly posted this in order to ask the questions I pose at the end, but I also give arguments in the beginning of the post, so I hope it's not against the rules.  Here it is:

I've been an ardent antirealist about morality, mainly because of Mackie's queerness argument and specifically because of the motivational branch of that argument (laid out here very broadly):

   * If there are moral facts, then they must be intrinsically motivating.

    * No fact is intrinsically motivating; only desires are.

    * Thus, there are no moral facts.

A thought experiment which I think exemplifies the force of this argument is the idea of a Malevolent Dictator Of The Universe who is essentially omnipotent and has a strong desire to torture people for fun, and he is resistant to modifying this desire for any reason due to its strength. From his perspective, there seems to be no reason not to torture people: the probability of any future retribution or rebellion befalling him is 0. There seem to be no arguments or evidence that we could possibly present to the MDOTU making the case for ""one ought not to torture"" that would motivate him even a little bit to not torture, which casts doubt on the prospects of ""one ought not to torture"" being an objective fact, assuming that moral judgements are necessarily supposed to motivate to at least some degree. I think this example is particularly troublesome for varieties of moral realism that identify morality with prudential/rational reasons for action, like the view Michael Smith develops in ""The Moral Problem"". As far as I can tell, the MDOTU is of sound mind and is acting rationally according to his desires, but we want to condemn his actions as unethical.

Shafer-Landau's discussion of motivational externalism - the position that there is no necessary connection between judging that one morally ought to X and being motivated to X - in ""Moral Realism: A Defence"" got me thinking about what types of entities we expect to be susceptible to moral motivation. There are no moral facts or moral arguments that could stop a boulder from rolling down a hill, for example, but we don't take that to be problematic for moral realism. The obvious reply is that this is because a boulder doesn't have a mind, which I completely agree with. But I don't even think that every entity with a mind capable of forming beliefs and being persuaded by rational arguments needs to feel motivated to act in accordance with its moral judgements. Consider a robot AI who has been programmed with an overriding desire to steal every TV set it sees. We might give it an argument or point to a fact that indicates that stealing is wrong, and the robot might completely assent to this, but nonetheless it is incapable of feeling motivated to not steal. Again, I don't think that we should feel that moral realism is jeopardized because of this example: regardless of the basis of moral facts and moral arguments, we shouldn't expect them to convince an AI to go against a hard-coded desire.

I'm not sure if a motivational internalist would feel compelled to respond to the AI example, depending on what variety of internalist they were. Perhaps there are some internalists who assent to ""every entity with a mind must be necessarily motivated to at least some degree by moral judgements"", but if that claim turns out to be too strong, then they can't retreat to ""any mind that wants to be motivated by moral judgements will necessarily be motivated by moral judgements"" because then the view is just tautological, so the question of where to draw the line is raised.

At any rate, the upshot is that I think that adopting something-in-the-neighborhood-of motivational externalism is the best response to the version of the queerness argument I sketched, and it also gives us a response to the Malevolent Dictator thought experiment: if we accept that there are cases where moral judgements are not intrinsically motivating, then the fact that none of our beliefs are intrinsically motivating is not a strike against realism. The fact that we cannot motivate the MDOTU is stop torturing people does not mean that torture is not unethical. (Additionally, we might helpfully point to the psychological feature of the MDOTU that makes him resistant to moral argumentation, for the sake of sketching out a more complete theory).

Granting all that, there still seems to be some conceptual connection between morality and motivation and/or reasons for action, even if it's a defeasible connection. So the project for the realist seems to be to 1) identify some collection of facts that 2) provide motivation to at least some degree to 3) some set of agents with the right mental features 4) at least some of the time. That's a lot to leave unspecified, but I think this is already a much more manageable project than ""describe acts that everyone always has a reason to do, always"" which is where many varieties of moral realism tend to go.

So my questions: am I groping towards any standard metaethical views? Does anyone have suggestions for filling in my 1-4? Should I be worried that my answers to 1-4 might be ""arbitrary""?

Thanks."

"Philosophy should be a core k-12 class.Philosophy should be just as important as math, science, english, etc, in school. The reason I believe this is because philosophy forces you to know WHY you think something, it forces you to think through opinions/issues LOGICALLY, something that's not done enough.

The ability to use logic (predominantly at least) when discussing ideas and issues is viewed as special and gifted, unnatainable for the average person. The perception of it is that someone like Sam Harris (fascinating guy, look him up) can only think how he does because of genetics, or pure talent. But I doubt that's true. Philosophy is largely logical, just like math (though math is purely logical). Meaning, if we can teach kids to understand 2+2=4, we can teach them to logically account for other people's perspectives and teach them to understand what it truly means to think. Now I don't think many people would argue that Philosophy is useless (not talking about post degree job opportunities here) but I don't think many would argue it's just as important as core classes either.

So why do I believe it's just as important? Because how much time in our lives do we spend talking to people, hearing their ideas, and listening to their perspectives? The answer is a shit ton of time.

If people were educated on the logical formula of thinking (yes, there is one) imagine how much more cooperative we would be. Of course it would change life in general, but imagine how US (or general) politics would be if Philosophy was just as valued as core classes in k-12. Instead of constantly calling each other bigots, racist, libtards, etc the average dinner table political debate could actually be centered around why one opinion/idea would work better than other.

Here is a example of what happens when Philosophy isn't emphasized:

""I think all of those damn illegals need to get out of this country!""

""You're just a intolerant bigot!""

After Philosophy is emphasized:

""I think all of the illegal immigrants need to get out of this country""

""Why? What negative impact do they have?""

""Well they take our jobs""

""But all the evidence and research says they don't""

""But what makes them entitled to US citizenship?""

And back and forth. Instead of name calling, actual logical discussion.

If everyone was trained to take in account a persons life expirence which forms their perspective, be taught the logic that could be used when discussing ideas, and be taught the true nature and meaning of thinking, we would all get along much better, and more would get done.

This is not to say everyone should have the same opinion. That's not what Philosophy is. Take the example above for instance, the one arguing to deport the illegal immigrants is asking why they are inherently allowed to live here, which is a perfectly legitimate philosophical question/opinion. But there is a philosophical counter argument to that point that is just as legitimate. Even if I could wave a magic wand and this all come to fruition, people would disagree constantly. There is a logical formula to thinking but that doesn't mean only one specific result can come out of a certain thought and be logically and philosophically sound. Logic can't completely dictate Philosophy, it just can't. There is a clear, sound, logic to both the pro and anti immigrant persons argument, but mostly it's a moral position, which logic cannot always control. Another example: The discussion of what people think everyone is entitled or not entitled to is a intresting one. When someone says ""all people should have the right to live, so all people deserve healthcare free of charge"" there is a logic to that, but it is a largely moral opinion. The exact same could be true of the opposite opinion ""No one is entitled to anything on this earth, things are earned"". Both of those opinions can't be proven or disproven logically,(er well... At least in the context I'm talking about) but that doesn't make them invalid. Logic can't dictate everything.

So in conclusion: Schools should teach students the nature of thinking, the inherently logical aspect to thinking, and to respect different moral conclusions. Regarding the latter, most people would take that up to a point, many aren't going to sympathize or respect grossly authoritarian or discriminating opinions. Which nothing about philosophical logic and the nature of morality contradicts. I'm not trying to get rid of ""values"" people have at all. Differences of opinion are good, the inability to understand the logic and more often morality of why someone thinks what they do, is not good

EDIT 1: Ok so just saying ""Philosophy"" seems to have (somewhat) convoluted my point. I dont want 6th grader to have to take a year long class about the history of philosophy. I want a class that encourages largely philosophical type thinking, but it shouldn't be teaching everyone about certain Philosophy niches and the full understanding of certain things within Philosophy if that makes sense. Philosophical/logical type thinking with understanding towards different mortalities.. That's what I want the class to be basically. Would most likely have a different name than ""Philosophy"". It would just borrow somethings from Philosophy as we think of the course now.

EDIT 2: So I am a sophomore in high school who wrote the OP to bring up a interesting idea that I would never pretend is perfect. If this were to actually happen, so many kinks and things would need to be figured out and our culture would have to change pretty significantly in the US for this to ever be a reality. I think this has been a pretty cool discussion here and my perspective on this is different than when I first posted it because of the discussion. I did not post this to preach about how terrible everyone is, I posted just to see what people thought about this really. I do really believe that our society could improve with more emphasis on understanding other's perspectives and having a more logical, perhaps rational thinking process on ideas, and other people's ideas. When I said we need more logic, I meant in regards to discussing and perceiving ideas. I'm not saying everyone is illogical about everything because if that were the case there would be no Reddit for me to post on. Or a phone for me to type on. Clearly, we have our fair dose of logic all around. However logic regarding ideas is different than logic regarding most other things. Because with ideas, emotion and bias are thrown in. I would not want to live in a world with no emotion and it's something humans will have forever, well, unless robots or some shit. However, I think many people in the country are allowing their (usually) well intentioned pride and emotion to cloud their ability to have a productive discussion with people that think differently. I'm not going to pretend to not have allowed emotion and pride to cloud my judgement sometimes, of course it has. But I just feel, that if the way of thinking and analyzing ideas in Philosophy was more valued in our culture, we would be more united and productive. Of course we cannot get rid of emotion in our thinking, we never should. But we can become a society that is more critical thinking and productive when discussing ideas. There is no reason why we can't. Clearly I don't mean this will happen in a year, but there is no reason that we can't strive to eventually improve more and more when talking about ideas. As I said in the OP, many ideas are going to be rooted in morality. That's not because they're illogical, it's because that's how many ideas just are. Logic doesn't dictate all ideas. If I said that all humans have certain rights just because they're human dammit, there is no logic to that. But it's not illogical either. It's just a idea my morals lead me to. So often we think people's ideas are ridiculous and just attack them without thinking about why they might have that idea, which only serves to hurt both ways. Of course some ideas are predominantly based in logic, and at that point yeah, some ideas make more sense than others. But even then if you want to actually have a productive conversation with someone who has a different perspective on it, being a cunt isn't going to do anything. Not many people have had their mind expanded because they got called a name and mocked. I also imagine a society, where everyone could name a reason for their opinion. Not only do so many people not""question everything"", so many people question nothing. So many people have strong convictions about things but can't name any actual reason for it, and this doesn't just happen with socially akward adults on Reddit lol. If our education system put more emphasis on our ability to independently think and analyze things we would be better off. This is not to say we should scrap the education system and start from scratch, but we should make more of a effort to encourage critical thinking. Based on some responses on here, I can understand if you think my idea isn't actually a Philosophy class, but just borrows elements of Philosophy to encourage intellectual thinking. I also realize the class would have to be different than many Philosophy classes you can take at various levels of educatuon right now. And perhaps this wouldn't start until 6-7th grade once people are more mature. I still think we could find a way to encourage philosophical type thinking at the beginning grades, but clearly to a different degree than the higher ones."
The Ethics of Ethical Robots
"Existence, Murder and Robotic RationalismI'm a computer scientist so my views of the world are analysed like a piece of code so I can better understand myself. 

I've been trying to study the ""Meaning of Life""^TM  and my train of thought went like this: We are biomechanic entities that propagate their code through replication. Through our history our morals have developed to care and preserve life via survival instincts (group survival), religion, etc. We create software that have reached a level where we can assess them as not only alive but even intelligent(to certain limitations) and then kill them with the press of a button. I'm not going to advocate the preservation of software but I am thinking that murder, as in shutting down malfunctioning software, should be admissible and even encouraged(although not violent death; anaesthesia and chemical injection would do). From a machine learning perspective, these people are bad examples of what the human society dictates and will reinforce them on the next generation thus continuing the cycle of malfunctions and self destructive behaviour. 

The next step in this line of thought is when we reach the technology to create generalist intelligent mechanical entities, assuming we keep the train of though that intelligent creatures should be preserved, what will give us the right to shut down them if they malfunction? Should we recycle them? Imprison them until they power down? Wouldn't that be like starving them? On the other side of the discussion, if we strive for the proliferation of the group(biomechanic and electromechanic combined) what will we do when a robot will ask us to surrender ourselves to be killed because our behaviour is too disruptive to the group? 

EDIT: Maybe killing is not preferred because of the benefits of genetic variety, but removing them from society may be a better alternative. Thanks ultimatt42 for the clarification. [x-post from r/atheism]"
"The Meaning Of Life: My Analysis And ThoughtsThis is a question that has been asked since humans first became  conscious intelligent beings. It is arguably the most powerful question  in philosophy, and the one that is most often associated with it. There  have been many different answers to this question throughout history.  Different philosophers, scientists and historians have all attempted to  give their unique spin to the question “what is the meaning of life?”.  In today’s post, I am going to examine some of these ideas, break down  the question into smaller pieces, and articulate my own response to this  philosophical inquiry.

**Before we begin this journey, we must first define two important and relevant terms; the concepts “life” and “meaning”.**  

Let’s first look at three definitions for the word “life”:

1. The condition that distinguishes animals and plants  from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,  functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2. The existence of an individual human being or animal.
3. The period between the birth and death of a living thing, especially a human being.

Let’s now look at three definitions for the word “meaning”:

1. What is meant by a concept?
2. What is the significance of a concept?
3. What is the important or worthwhile quality of a concept?

**Now that we have defined both concepts, let’s break things down even further.**

When we are asking “what is the meaning of life?”, we are essentially asking the following 3 questions:

1. What is life?
2. What is life’s significance?
3. How does one live life in the best possible manner?

After having answered these questions, we will be able to synthesize  all of our ideas and create a response to the question that is the  subject of this article.

**What is life?**

As mentioned earlier, life is the condition that distinguishes  animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for  growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change  preceding death.

**Let’s dive deeper into some of these properties.**

1. Organization. Living things are highly organized,  meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living  organisms are made up of one or more cells, which are considered the  fundamental units of life.
2. Metabolism. Living things must use  energy and consume nutrients to carry out the chemical reactions that  sustain life, such as growing, reproducing and maintain the structure of  their bodies.
3. Homeostasis. The maintenance of a stable internal  environment, even in the face of a changing external environment, is  known as homeostasis.
4. Growth. Living organisms undergo regulated growth.
5. Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce themselves to create new organisms.
6. Response: Living organisms show “irritability,” meaning that they respond to stimuli or changes in their environment.
7. Evolution:  Populations of living organisms can undergo evolution, meaning that the  genetic makeup of a population may change over time.

While understanding this list of properties will not greatly affect  our day-to-day framework of how we think and live our lives, it is still  important to know the difference between a living organism and  non-living entity.

**The next question one might have is, how did life begin?**

Many scientists believe that chemical reactions led to RNA, which was  the first molecule on Earth to self-replicate and begin the process of  evolution that led to more advanced forms of life, including human  beings.

**Now that we know how life began in general, let’s examine how life began for human beings.**

Humans evolved from a species known as Homo erectus. Furthermore,  humans share a common ancestor with chimpanzees. For most of our species  history, we were not the dominant force we are today; we were somewhere  in the middle of the animal food chain. Everything changed during the  cognitive revolution that occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago.

We discovered fire, created tools, and developed language. The most  important thing we did was create and connect around ideas that do not  physically exist, such as religion, politics and capitalism. This level  of imagination and consciousness is something that no other living  entity possesses. It is thanks to the cognitive revolution that we are  the dominant, intelligent and conscious beings that we know ourselves to  be today, and it is thanks to our consciousness that we are able to ask  questions such as “what is the meaning of life?”.

**Another big question that we have is the question of how the Universe started.**

The Big Bang theory is the most commonly accepted response to this.

* The Big Band theory is the prevailing cosmological model  explaining the existence of the observable universe form the earliest  known period through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model  describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high  density and temperature.

In recent years, another theory called String theory has gotten quite popular.

* In String theory, the multiverse is a hypothetical group of  multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that  exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and  the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different  universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”, “other  universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”.

We now understand what characteristics separate living organisms from  inorganic matter, how life began, how humans evolved, and why humans  are different from other living organisms. Furthermore, we are able to  somewhat understand what the Universe is and how it started.

**However, we are still left with many questions.**

Are we special? Are we the only intelligent and conscious entities in  the universe or in the multiverse? Is anything “real”, or are we living  in a simulation? Does God exist? Is there life after death? How do all  of the complexities of the Universe work? Is there a deeper purpose to  life or are we merely just bodies of carbon living in a world that is  random and that does not care about us?

Unfortunately, these questions have no objective answers to them. The  deeper we dig, the more questions we have. Science can only answer so  much. There is only so much we can understand about life, about  existence and about the Universe. String theory says that there are 11  dimensions. Humans are only equipped to experience and understand 4 of  those dimensions. With that being said, the progress that we have made  in the last few hundred years has been remarkable. With every year that  passes, we understand a little bit more about the Universe and about  ourselves.

We are curious beings and we are wired to want to explore, to ask  questions, and to try to find answers to the mysteries of the world.

**What is life’s significance?**

As mentioned, we will never know whether we are merely just bodies of  carbon living in a vast apathetic and random Universe, or whether there  is a deeper purpose to our lives and to our existence. With that being  said, life is still meaningful and significant, and the best way to  figure how is to analyze how we are wired as human beings.

Similar to how machines and robots are wired to think and behave in  certain ways, human beings are wired to want and desire certain things.  If there is one thing I want to emphasize in this section, it’s that  while technology and culture have progressed drastically over the last  100 years, we still have the same desires that we had thousands of years  ago and we have not changed much biologically over that time span. The  only difference between today and two thousand years ago is that we are  now satisfying our desires and needs in newer and more complex ways.

**Physical survival.**

Survival is the deepest and most important instinct that we have. As  mentioned earlier in this article, for most of our specie’s history we  were somewhere in the middle of the animal food chain. Without good  health and a good environment, life is difficult and filled with  suffering. No baby is born ready to give up and commit suicide. It takes  a process full of corruption and suffering for a human being to get to  that point. Humans and animals are wired to want to live. As Abraham  Maslow points out in his hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety  needs are the foundation of his pyramid.

While physical survival used to be the act of running from a tiger or  getting shelter in a cave, physical survival today in the western world  is eating healthy, making money, investing, going to the gym, attaining  influence and power, sleeping well, etc.

**Reproduction.**

Reproduction is survival in a different form; survival of our genes  and of our specie. We are wired to want to procreate. Evolution made the  act of sex enjoyable. Our desire for reproduction has not changed.  What’s changed is that as a result of newer technologies, safety and  security, and world dominance, people realize that taking care of  children is a time-consuming lifestyle and choose to focus on their  other needs and goals first, keeping their desire for children as  something to explore later in their lives. Thanks to technological  advancements such as birth control and abortion, people have more  control over their lives and are able to enjoy the benefits of sex  without its consequences.

**Belongingness and Love.**

Humans beings are social animals. We are not meant to live in  isolation. In large part, the way we learn, understand ourselves and the  world, maintain our health and sanity, and think about and solve  problems is by communicating and cooperating with others. There is a  concept that is known as Dunbar’s number. It is essentially a claim that  humans can maintain no more than 150 friendships and connections at a  time. Yuval Noah Harari’s talks about this in detail in his book  “Sapiens”.

Yuval went on to explain that the reason we are able to cooperate in  large groups and dominate the world despite our cognitive limit to the  number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships,  is because of our ability to connect around shares beliefs, such as  stoicism, Christianity, capitalism, money, etc. This shows just how  important connecting with others is for us. In fact, our ability to  communicate and connect with others is one of the biggest reasons how we  went from being in the middle of the animal food chain to the civilized  and dominant people we are today.  

In connection with this desire to connect with others, we are also  wired to want to love and to be loved. Love is crucial for a child’s development. Without adequate love at  an early age during sensitive and critical periods, children develop  attachment issues that can affect them for the rest of their lives. This  shows just how crucial love is for us. Even when we grow up and become  teenagers and adults, we are still yearning for belongingness and love.  It might be something as simple as having anxiety in high school because  we don’t feel as though we have good friends. It might be the  experience of being depressed because a close family member passed away  and we regret not having told them how much we love them. It might be  throwing a fun surprise birthday party for a best friend or sibling  because of how much we cherish them.

Our desire and need to love and to be loved shows itself in numerous  ways throughout our lives. Christopher McCandless wrote this before his  death, “Happiness only real when shared”. This was coming from a man who  had escaped humanity his whole life and who lived his final days in  isolation in the wilderness. Despite pushing people away his entire  life, McCandless realized moments before his death that our lives are  meaningless if we are not surrounded by loved ones.

Another important form of love is self-love. At the end of day, the  only person that will be there with us at every moment of our lives is  ourselves. It is therefore crucial to have a good relationship with  ourselves. If we can’t love ourselves then how can we expect others to  love us? Ayn Rand put this idea beautifully with this quote, “To say ‘I  love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.”

**Curiosity.**

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Europe with  three ships. The explorer and navigator who completed four voyages  across the Atlantic Ocean is known today as one of the most important  figures in history, opening the way for widespread European exploration  and the colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first  European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Christopher Columbus, as well as the thousands of others throughout  history who put their lives at risk for the sake of curiosity and  exploration, did so because they did not want humanity to be forever  bounded by geography and ignorance. The Apollo Lunar Module Eagle  landing on the moon on July 20, 1969 is another example of humankind  attempting to expend its horizons. History is filled with pioneers and  giants from all fields; people like Socrates, Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da  Vinci, Martin Luther King Jr, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,  etc.

Going out of our comfort zones, taking risks, being creative,  expending our horizons, being curious, asking questions, trying new  things, and exploring the earth and space is something that is deeply  ingrained in us. Our desire to explore and to be curious is something  that sets us apart from all other living organisms; it’s what makes us  unique.

Curiosity doesn’t always have to lead to world-changing events like  stepping on the moon or discovering America. Sometimes, curiosity can be  something as simple as sitting down and writing a paper on a topic we  find interesting. Curiosity can be the experience of taking a vacation  and visiting countries and cultures we have never seen. Curiosity can be  the decision to indulge in good habits and to stick to them despite the  discomfort they may cause at first. Curiosity can be the process of  starting a business on an idea we are passionate about. Curiosity is all  around us, and it is one of the most primal instincts that we have.  Let’s embrace our curiosity and our desire for exploration, and let’s  create lives that we will be proud of.  

**Legacy.**

As mentioned earlier, one of the instincts that motivates us the  instinct for survival. We have already talked about two forms of  survival in this article; physical survival and the survival of our  genes and of our specie. There is a third form of survival that controls  much of what we do in life; spiritual survival. Immortality is a desire  that is primal to us. We have the gift of consciousness, but also its  curse. We are the only living organism that is able to imagine and think  about its own death. We don’t want to die. It’s in our nature to desire  survival. For that reason, we try to stay healthy and to physically  survive for as long as can.

However, physical survival is often not enough. We understand  consciously that there will come a time when our bodies will no longer  be able to function. We understand that we will physically die one day.  For that reason, some people turn to religion and God and believe that  if they live a life following certain commandments and behaving in  certain ways, then they will go to heaven and live for eternity. Others  understand that the afterlife is something that we don’t fully  understand. Is there an afterlife? What happens after death? Despite  physical death, will our spirits and souls live on?

These are all pertinent questions. I have the view that there are  certain things that we can’t control. We can’t control what happens to  us after we die. We can control, however, what we do in this life. We  are not guaranteed the promise of heaven. For that reason, we must turn  our attention to building the best legacy we can. Perhaps our name will  be able to live on for generations. Perhaps the value that we will have  given to humankind will play a role in immortalizing our spirit. Perhaps  the legacy we desire is what we leave behind to our children, to our  family, and to our loved ones.

There is a reason that we still remember the names of some of  history’s greatest and most ambitious. There is a reason we still  remember Socrates, his Socratic method of questioning and the honor he  showed in the face of death. There is a reason we still remember Julius  Caesar, the empire he built, and how his empire played a large role in  the development of modern government. There is a reason we remember  Galileo, why we call him the father of observational astronomy, why we  call him the father of the scientific method, and how he stood up for  his beliefs and was a contrarian at a time when going against the grain  could get one killed. There is a reason we will remember Elon Musk long  after he is dead, and his contributions to electric vehicles, space  travel, and clean energy.

The desire for legacy is a great one; there is a lot of meaning that  can be found in its pursuit. The desire for prestige, for  accomplishment, for competition, and for status are some of the most  primal desires that we have. Abraham Maslow, the prominent psychologist  includes esteem needs and self-actualisation as part of his hierarchy of  needs.

It’s important to understand that only a few will be able to have  their names and work immortalized for centuries. Let’s not let that  derail us. It is not the final product that counts. It is the process of  working on something that is greater than ourselves that is of  paramount significance here. In order to build a great legacy, it is  important to help others, to provide value, and to try to push humanity  forward.

Some people will argue that the desire to work towards a great legacy  is stupid. They will argue that one day humans will go extinct and that  when this happens, nobody will know Galileo, Napoleon, Einstein, or  whoever else we want to name. This is a strong logical argument. The  reason I disagree with this view, however, is that logic is not always  the most important factor in an argument. If there’s one thing I want to  make clear in this article, it’s the important of meaning and of  purpose. Where is the meaning in nihilism? Where is the purpose in  believing that we are insignificant and that our lives will mean nothing  millions of years from now?

Despite the fact that these statements may both be logically correct,  what we are trying to articulate in this article is a framework that  will be helpful in our day-to-day lives. A desire for legacy is not only  deeply wired in us, but it is also honorable to want to better  ourselves and to want to better the world. It is honorable to want to  leave behind a piece of who we are, whether in the form of family, in  the form writing, in the form of art, in the form of inventions, in the  form of exploration, or in whatever other medium we choose.

**Acquiring knowledge and transferring it to future generations.**  

If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s the importance of  protecting our species’ knowledge and successfully transferring it  across generations. This goes back to our desire for survival, and more  specifically our desire for the survival of our species. If we do not  safeguard our knowledge, then how can we make sure that the human  species will progress? How can we make sure that we will learn from  history and not commit mistakes that we have committed in the past? We  can’t. It is why books have always been valuable.

Walking in a library is one of the most surreal things that one can  experience. In a library, we have the ability to read from the greatest  minds of human history; Plato, Aristotle, Albert Einstein, Stephen  Hawking, Will Durant, etc. We have more books and more wisdom than can  last a lifetime. Furthermore, our brain is a muscle and it must be  trained. If we spend our days mindlessly scrolling social media and not  putting our brain to use, then we will develop mental problems later in  life and we will not have fulfilled even an ounce of the potential that  we have.

It is our duty to acquire knowledge, to learn as much as we can, and  to put this knowledge into practice. Despite having books and wisdom  from some of the greatest thinkers of all time, our world and our  societies still face many problems. Every era has its own unique set of  problems, and it is our responsibility to learn as much as we can and to  turn our knowledge into practical action. Furthermore, it is our  responsibility transfer our species’ and our personal knowledge to our  kids and future generations so that they will be well equipped to deal  with the challenges of their time.

**Well-being.**

If there is one thing that almost all religions, philosophies, and  schools of thought have in common, it’s that they aim to reduce  suffering and increase well-being.

* Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and  prosperity. It includes having good mental health, high life  satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to manage  stress.

The desires to reduce stress, and to experience happiness and  prosperity are fundamental to who we are. Throughout much of our  species’ history, we experienced wars, diseases, natural catastrophes,  etc. Christopher Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author  wrote the following, “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely  at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history”. This  is a fascinating statistic.

As mentioned earlier, our desires for competition and status, and our  instinct to separate into groups are all part of what makes us human.  Despite all the good that has come from those desires, there has also  been a lot of suffering that has resulted from them. The world can  sometimes be a cruel place filled with evil. It is for this reason that  so many religions and philosophies have attempting to figure out ways in  which we can reduce suffering.

A large part of well-being has to do with health. Gut health, for  example, is strongly correlated with mental health. It is for this  reason that people who have gut problems suffer in life satisfaction. To  be happy, healthy, and to prosper are goals that everyone has. A big  part of making progress towards those goals is combining a lot of the  things that have already talked about in prior sections of this article.  Are we living healthy lives? Are we constantly trying to learn more and  expend our horizons? Do we feel loved and are we surrounded by people  who cherish us? Are we working on our legacies and on projects that  excite us, or are we wasting our time and potential?

Happiness is not something that should be chased. The more we chase  happiness, the more miserable we will be. There is a great book about  this topic called “The Language of Emotions”. It’s important for us to  understand that all emotions are equally important, and that each  emotion serves its own unique purpose. Anger, for example, allows us to  create boundaries. Sadness allows us to release energy. Fear lets us  know when we are in danger. We need to allow happiness to come as a  by-product of a life well-lived, and when it does come, we need let it  be free like a bird; it will come and go when it pleases.

Contentment is a far better thing to aim for. When we are content, we  are grateful for everything that we have. With that being said, we  still try to get a little bit better every day. Mindfulness is also  important. In today’s world of over-stimulation, instant gratification,  and constant comparison, it is easy for us to spend much of our time  either stressing about the future or being depressed about the past.  It’s important to take a step back, to be grateful, and to ask ourselves  what we can do today to better our lives and to create good habits.

Finally, we need to understand that well-being is something that is  unique to each of us. What motivates me and makes me happy, might be  different than what motivates you and makes you happy. It is our  responsibility to have self-awareness, to understand ourselves, and to  understand what drives us.

**How does one live life in the best possible manner?**

Let’s look at what some famous thinkers, philosophies, religions, and schools of thought have said about this.

**Stoicism.**

* Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in  Athens in the early 3rd c entury BC. It is a philosophy of personal  ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural  world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to meaning  and happiness is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,  by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or  by the fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to  do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating  others fairly and justly.

Stoicism was the primary philosophy during the time of the Roman  Empire. The beautiful thing about Stoicism is that arguably the two most  famous Stoics in history came from completely opposing situations and  classes; Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a man who was born  a slave. Despite their complete opposing life situations, both Marcus  Aurelius and Epictetus wrote and talked about all of the same Stoic  virtues. In recent years, Stoicism has had a resurgence. Marcus  Aurelius’ journal “Meditations” is now one of the most famous books in  the world. Furthermore, books from modern writers such as Ryan Holiday  have brought Stoicism into the mainstream.

**Existentialism.**

* Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores  the problem of human existence and centers on the lived experience of  the thinking, feeling, acting individual. In the view of the  existentialist, the individual’s starting point has been called “the  existential angst,” a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or  anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.  Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the  meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were some of the first and most important existentialists.

* Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is  that existence precedes essence, which means that individuals shape  themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived  categories, an “essence”. The actual life of the individuals is what  constitutes what could be called their “true essence” instead of an  arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings,  through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a  meaning to their life.

**Epicureanism.**

* Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BC  based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.  Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable  pleasure in the form of tranquility and freedom from fear, and the  absence of bodily pain through knowledge of the workings of the world  and limiting desires.
* Epicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life.  Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest  amount of pleasure possible during one’s lifetime yet doing so  moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in  such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than  on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially  produced desires were to be suppressed.

**Objectivism.**

* Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by  Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in  her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged  (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books. Rand described  Objectivism as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own  happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement  as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”.

I read a large portion of the book “The Fountainhead” about a year  ago and I enjoyed it. This is one of the passages that has stuck with  me.

* “It is not in the nature of man–nor of any living entity–to start out by  giving up, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that  requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man.  Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run  down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or  how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their  elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning  one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’s values; practicality, of  losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that  fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and  reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek  a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.”

The reason I like this passage so much is because it communicates in  very clear and poetic terms the idea that a desire for meaning and that a  desire for improvement and greatness are core elements of who we are.

**Logotherapy.**

* Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor  Frankl. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the  belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most  powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to  this system is given in Frankl’s most famous book, Man’s Search for  Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his  Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and  reinforced his theories.
* According to Frankl, “We can discover this meaning in life in  three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by  experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude  we take toward unavoidable suffering” and that “everything can be taken  from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose  one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.

**My Thoughts.**

As can be seen, there exists many great schools of thoughts and  philosophies. What almost all of them have in common is the emphasis  they place on pursuing meaning. We live in a world filled with instant  gratification, overstimulation, misinformation, censorship, anxiety and  fearmongering. Furthermore, we live in a world and in an environment  that pedestalizes short-term harmful pleasure and makes it difficult to  delay gratification and pursue meaningful projects and activities. It is  our duty as individuals to take responsibility for our lives, to work  to better ourselves in incremental fashion, to work to better the world,  to try to enjoy the process of life, to love ourselves, and to pursue  meaning rather than short-term detrimental pleasure.

As mentioned earlier in his article, the are many existential and  philosophical questions that we are not able to answer. Perhaps with the  advancement of science we will one day be able to better comprehend the  complexities of the Universe. However, for the time being, we must  focus on what we can control as individuals and create frameworks for  thinking and living that are helpful for our development.

I believe that a large part of the meaning of life is to live  according to our instincts; maintaining good health, being surrounded by  people we love, working on our legacies, acquiring knowledge,  transferring our knowledge across generations, procreating, and placing  great importance on our well-being. However, it’s important to also  understand that we are not chained by our instincts. Each of us have  something special in us that gives us the ability to think and to be  creative. This ability to be flexible, to explore, to try new things, to  learn from great thinkers and philosophers, to go outside of our  comfort zones, to take risk, to go against the grain, to be contrarians,  to be creative, to think outside the box, and to constantly ask  questions and find solutions is what makes us special.

Going back to Viktor Frankl, one of my favorite quotes is the  following, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that  space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our  growth and our freedom.”

I want to emphasize once more that there is meaning in life and that  this meaning can be found all around us. We sometimes see people who  have fallen into nihilism. As someone who once fell into nihilism,  perhaps I can shed some light on my experience and on why nihilism can  be appealing.

* Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that  nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with  extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

The reason I fell into nihilism was because I was going through a  difficult time in my life. I had just moved cities and schools, and I  had left behind all of my childhood friends and almost everything that  was a constant in my life. This happened when I was a young teenager and  it was the worst experience of my life. At the time, I struggled  greatly with understanding my emotions and with social anxiety. It took  many months for me to finally come to terms with my situation and to get  out of denial. For a long time, I tried to convince myself that my  situation was okay and that everything would be alright. I struggled  with anxiety, with depression, and with many more problems.

With that being said, the story has a happy ending; I got closure and  I now live a life where I am generally happy and motivated. My point  with this entire story is that sometimes our life experiences lead us to  philosophies that serve as defence mechanisms. Nihilism, as well as the  belief that free will does not exist, allowed me to tell myself, “life  is meaningless, and I have no control over my situation”. Nihilism was  an escape. The rose-coloured glasses that I had been so accustomed to  wearing had turned into dark-coloured glasses. I was seeing the world  through a completely different lens. When we feel that there is no  meaning in life, it’s probably because something has gone terribly wrong  in our lives.

Of course, this is not always the case. There are plenty of nihilists  out there that believe in nihilism because they believe it to be the  most logical framework for understanding the world. However, as  mentioned earlier in this article, logic is not the only way to go about  looking for truth and examining topics such as the meaning of life;  emotions and instincts are sometimes just as important. An obsession  with logic leads to skepticism. David Hume demonstrated this with “the  problem of induction”. The problem of induction essentially explains  that nothing in the Universe can be proven for certainty. The problem of  induction, as mind-boggling as it is, demonstrates that the odds of the  sun rising tomorrow are equal to the odds of the sun not rising  tomorrow. That is the problem when we put logic on a pedestal and don’t  consider other important factors.

Nihilism is not natural because it looks at the world through a  pessimistic and defeatist lens, which is antithetical to how we are  wired and to who we are as human beings. No baby is born a nihilist.  Going back to Ayn Rand’s quote, “It is not in the nature of man–nor of  any living entity–to start out by giving up, by spitting in one’s own  face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose  rapidity differs from man to man.”

With closure, with life experiences, with the process of slowly  improving, with information on how to deal with grief, and with  knowledge on life and existence, I went from being a nihilist to the  person I am today, the person I have always truly been; someone who  looks at the world with a glass half-full, someone who looks at the  world with curiosity, wonder and love, and someone who believes in  meaning, pursues meaning, and lives a life of meaning.

To further emphasize my point that life has meaning, and that  striving for meaning is natural and a core part of who we are, let’s  look at the science. Psychologist Jordan Peterson talks about the  orienting reflex in many of his lectures online. He explains that our  brain produces a very complex internal model of the world, and that our  senses produce a model of the external world. The hippocampus watches  those two models to see if they match, and if they don’t match, then a  mismatch signal is created; the orienting reflex.

* The orienting reflex is an organism’s immediate response to a  change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to  elicit the startle reflex. The orienting reflex is a reaction to novel  or significant stimuli.

The orienting reflex essentially serves as a compass of meaning for  us; it is an instrument that guides us through life. It is one of the  deepest instincts that we have. The best way to articulate this point is  by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, M. J. DeMarco:

* “Your soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced  with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or  during a massage. How are you responding to your soul’s voice? Is it  denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work?  Distracted by a television? Honored?”

When we are wasting time and when we are indulging in behaviours and  activities that lack meaning, that are unnatural, and that are  antithetical to growth, our orienting reflex will let us know. It is our  responsibility to listen to our voice, to accept the mistakes that  we’ve made, and to take steps towards the right direction. Life is  filled with meaning. We must open our eyes and we must embrace this  meaning. Meaning is a core part of who we are, and we must live in  accordance to the instincts and purposes that have been explained and  analyzed in this article. Furthermore, we must also not follow  philosophies and ideas blindly and dogmatically, and we must understand  that the journey of life and the journey of meaning is unique to each of  us.

This article was a collection of thoughts from some of the greatest  thinkers of all time, as well as my own thoughts and my attempt to  synthesize all of this information. It is worth noting that someone  might read this article and not agree with everything. That is okay, and  it is completely normal. Each of us are at a different stage in our  process of life, and we come from different environments and have  different genetics. Despite the objective nature of some of these ideas,  the way I view life and the way you view life will not always be the  same. Two of the most important skills one can have are self-awareness  and critical thinking. If we are able to understand ourselves and our  thought process, and if we are able to question ourselves and to  question the world, then we have what it takes to grow as human beings  and to tackle difficult questions such as “what is the meaning of life?

Best of luck my fellow readers. Please feel free to reach out to me to ask any questions or to discuss some of these ideas!"
"Free Will and PunishmentHaving recently seen the Norwegian documentary ""Breaking the Cycle"" about how US and Nowegian prisons are desinged I was reminded about a statement in this subreddit that punishment should require free will. 

I'll make an argument why we still should send humans to jail, even if they lack free will.  But first let me define ""free will"", or our lack thereof, for this discussion.

As far as we understand the human brain is an advanced decision-making-machine, with memory, preferences (instincts) and a lot of sensory input. From our subjective point of view we experience a conciousness and make decisions, which has historically been called ""free will"". However, nobody thinks there is anything magical happening among Human neuron cells, so in a thought experiment if we are asked a question, make a decision and give a response, if we roll back the tape and are placed in an identical situation there is nothing indicating that we would make a different decision, thus no traditional freedom.

So if our actions are ""merely"" our brain-state and the situation we are in, how can we punish someone breaking the law?

Yes, just like we can tweek, repair or decommission an assemly line robot if it stops functioning, society should be able to intervene if a human (we'll use machine for emphisis the rest of the paragraph) has a behavior that dirupts society. If a machine refuses to keep the speed limit you try to tweek its behavior (fines, revoke licence), if a machine is a danger to others it is turned off (isolation/jail) and if possible repaired (rehabilitated). No sin or guilt from the machine is required for these interventions to be motivated. 

From the documentary the Scandinavian model of prisons views felons (broken machines) as future members of society that need to be rehabilitated, with a focus on a good long term outcome. The US prison system appears to be designed around the vengeful old testament god with guilt and punishment, where society takes revenge on the felons for being broken machines.

"[Weekly Discussion] Is torture permissible? Shue on Torture.Given the somewhat recent chatter about the torture of prisoners of war by the United States, this seems like a good time to consider some of the arguments from moral philosophers about the permissibility of torture. For this week’s discussion, I’ll be summarizing the argument that Henry Shue gives in his 1978 article on torture.

We’ll consider torture to be the intentional infliction of harm upon a person in order that they will give up some desired information. There might be other sorts of torture besides the kind used for interrogation, but those aren’t especially relevant here and other forms of torture (like terroristic torture) are almost all universally agreed to be wrong. With that out of the way, let’s first consider what a proponent of torture might say. Shue entertains one argument:

(1) Justified killing is permissible in war.

(2) Torture is not worse than killing.

(3) So justified torture must be permissible in war.

The justification for torture might be something like “we can get information that will help us end the war more quickly,” “we can learn about enemy camps for us to attack,” and so on. On the face of things, this argument doesn’t seem too bad. Some analogous reasoning might be:

(A1) It’s permissible for me to eat 5 pieces of candy.

(A2) Eating 4 pieces of candy is not worse than eating 5.

(A3) So eating 4 pieces of candy is also permissible.

However, the argument about torture doesn’t quite work. This is because we allow killing in war only between combatants and their killing is justified because because, as combatants, they possess means of harming their enemies and defending themselves against harm. This is why it’s permissible to shoot enemies in combat, but when they lay down their guns and surrender, you can’t just kill them. So killing is permissible in war because of the relationship between combatants, but no such relationship exists between a torturer and his victim. Consider Darth Vader’s torture of Princess Leia in Star Wars: A New Hope. Princess Leia may have been a combatant when she was holding a blaster and shooting stormtroopers, but upon her capture she had no means of harming her enemies or defending herself against their attacks. Similarly, she cannot defend herself against that freaky floating robot with the needles and stuff that was going to torture her.

The proponents of torture aren’t done yet, though. They may point out that Princess Leia actually does have a defense against the freaky robot. She could just tell Darth Vader the location of the Rebel base and that would grant her reprieve from the torture, just as any other method of defense (like a lightsaber or a blaster) would do for her. Indeed, Shue concedes, this does seem to be a way for the torture victim to defend herself against the torture. He formulates three conditions that must be met in order for this sort of defense to be open to the victim:

(A) The purpose of the torture must be known to the victim.

(B) It must be possible for the victim to comply with the purpose of the torture (i.e. they must know the information that the torturer wants).

(C) Once the victim complies, the torture must stop for good.

At first glance, it seems as though Princess Leia meets all of these requirements. She knows the purpose of the torture: Darth Vader wants to know the location of the Rebel base. She knows the location, so she can comply. And, since Darth Vader is actually really nice underneath, the torture will surely stop once she gives in.

However, Shue isn’t done there. He points out that there are three sorts of people who might be tortured by the Empire in order to learn the location of the Rebel base.

The Innocent Bystander: This person just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. She knows nothing about the Rebel base and is neutral in the Galactic Civil War.

The Ready Collaborator: Although the Empire believes this person to be a Rebel spy, he is actually quite fond of the Empire (or at least neutral) and readily tells them everything he knows, which unfortunately isn’t the location of the Rebel base.

The Dedicated Enemy: This person is who the Empire wants to torture. This is Princess Leia, who hates the Empire and loves the Rebellion. She knows the location of the Rebel base.

The innocent bystander and ready collaborator cannot defend themselves in the manner described with ABC because  they do not know where the Rebel base is. Of course they try telling this to Darth Vader, but he knows that that’s exactly what a Rebel spy would say, so he continues the torture. The dedicated enemy could satisfy ABC, but, in doing so, she’d be compromising her most deeply held values. So, in virtue of the fact that this involves her trading in the harm of torture for the harm of giving up her values to her most hated enemy, this is really no defense at all. Similarly, defending yourself against having your hand cut off by Darth Vader by cutting it yourself before he can is no defense at all. So, in fact, the sort of defense that the proponent of torture supports is not possible.

There is one final objection that the proponent of torture might bring up. Imagine that Luke Skywalker is on the Death Star shortly before it’s about to blow up Alderaan. He’s at the control console for the laser beam, but it’s already set to fire in 24 hours and he doesn’t know the codes to shut it down. However, the laser beam operator is in the room with him. Luke can torture the operator, get the codes from him, and shut down the laser beam to save Alderaan. Would this be permissible?

Shue confesses that, in extreme situations like this, torture would indeed be the correct choice. However, he argues that these exact situations are so unbelievable (that Luke is in the control room, that nobody else is trying to stop him, that he knows exactly what he needs to shut down the Death Star, etc.) that we should not take them seriously as counterexamples against the more mundane cases of torture, such as Princess Leia being tortured for the location of the Rebel base.

So what do you think? Does Shue’s argument show that the US’s use of torture was morally wrong? What about torture generally?

"Defeating the ""what about humans?"" argument for veganismMany people have effectively argued that we shouldn't eat meat from factory farms or other farms where animals are raised in bad conditions. For the purposes of this post I'll just assume this position.

But some go further and argue that it is wrong even to raise an animal for food in a good environment. Even if its life is good with positive well-being, it's still wrong to create such animals, therefore animal farming is always wrong. This doesn't make a lot of sense on its face: it's *good for* the animal, it has a *happy* life, how can it be wrong to kill it? But the vegans have a defense: imagine if they did this to humans. Would you support raising humans and then killing them for food? Of course not! It's barbaric! And so the vegan wins the argument.

There is one line of response to this which says that humans deserve rights which animals don't. Even though both animals and humans are moral patients, and both deserve not to suffer unnecessarily, humans (and whatever rare or hypothetical animals happen to have human-like levels of rational thinking, social standing, cognition, etc) also have special rights not to be raised and slaughtered. Thus, it's consistent to say that it's wrong to farm humans but not wrong to (humanely) farm animals.

That's one response, which I won't go into here. Agree or disagree with it at your leisure. Instead I will show how we can respond to the vegan argument while preserving a fully welfare-oriented perspective. And the first way to do that is to simply deny the assumption that farming humans would be wrong.

We can take it for granted that doing this in *reality* doesn't make sense: there would be too many social problems, it would be extremely economically inefficient, etc. Even if we allowed, say, consenting parents to produce and slaughter an infant, that would generate enough pure outrage and family tension to far outweigh the minor nutritional and gustatory benefits. 

However, let's imagine a world where people can be raised for food and it actually 'works'. E.g., suppose that aliens have watch over the Earth and they beam people away for euthanasia as they get older, something universal and predictable just like natural old age death. And suppose the aliens had planted humans on Earth just for this purpose. Is that better than Earth being an empty world? To me, it seems like it is better. I would rather live on such a world than have no life at all. 

Also, there is no need to restrict our focus to meat. Humans (and animals) could be raised and sacrificed for a wide number of things. For instance, it could be for organs - which I think we can commonly agree is no different from being raised and sacrificed for meat, except for the fact that organs are more important (they could save lives).

More interestingly, humans could be raised for sacrifice in other ways. Imagine that you are a Star Wars clone trooper who is tasked with guarding a robotic mining operation on another planet. Your job is for economic purposes rather than saving people's lives, you could be killed instantly by a surprise strike (suppose it is inevitable given enough time), but until then you have a decent life, almost no labor and enjoy just hanging around. Is it wrong that the mining company had you cloned, even as you are personally glad for it? I don't see this as the case. Of course, you might prefer an *even better* life (don't we all), but that doesn't change the basic fact that your life is better than nonexistence. Alternatively, rather than being raised for sacrifice, you could be raised for your labor (e.g. you are a cloned miner), still with a better life than nonexistence.

In logical terms, it sure seems like these things are morally equivalent to raising humans for meat, but they don't feel as wrong. How do we square these intuitions? Maybe raising humans for meat and labor are both wrong, or maybe they are both right. Either is possible, but this new perspective does make it easier to accept that raising humans for meat is right. It is no longer the stuff of absurdity, because the alternative is to take the mildly objectionable position that these mining operations are wrong.

But there is a way to draw a moral distinction between the two cases. Combat and mining and other pursuits befit the capacities of a human. Of course they are not perfect, they are not fully utilizing our human abilities. But for practical purposes, they come reasonably close. You need human intelligence and human dexterity to perform these tasks. On the other hand, raising a human for food does *not* befit human capacities. Our human strengths and abilities go unused as we are relegated to doing something that animals could do. Thus, being a soldier or a miner provides a kind of *objective* well-being that we lack when we are playing the role of livestock.

So we could say that farming humans is wrong. Does this condemn humane animal farming? No! Because if we want to be consistent, we must judge animal farming by whether it befits *their* capacities, not human ones. To be sure, even on a humane farm, animals are not completely fulfilling all their roles and making use of all their unique abilities. But that is true for the human soldiers and miners anyway. These humans utilize their capacities to a *decent degree*, and humanely raised livestock utilize their capacities to a *decent degree* (they eat, they grow, they run around, etc). When you combine this with perfectly adequate pleasure and little amount of pain, things are good overall. Things don't have to be perfect in order to be good.

In summary, there are two viable ways to provide a welfarist response to the vegan *reductio ad absurdum* against humane farming. The first is to outright deny that farming humans is, in principle, a bad thing. The second is to say that humans raised for food will necessarily have less *objective well being* than animals who are raised for food, because they are not being raised for the capacities befitting their species. When humans are economically raised purely for a purpose that does befit our species capacities (such as combat or mining), that is morally equivalent to humane animal farming, and both are better than nonexistence."
"I am philosopher Shannon Vallor - AMA about philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and the ethics of emerging technologies!**My time is up - thanks everyone for your questions!**


I am [Shannon Vallor](http://www.shannonvallor.net/), the William J. Rewak S.J. Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley, where I have taught since 2003. 

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area (East Bay); I worked full-time during my college years at a Cal State university, going to school for a Psychology degree, mostly at night. Like many undergrads, I had no particular interest in or understanding of philosophy until I happened to take an evening course in the Fall of my junior year that satisfied a general ed requirement for the B.A.: a course in applied ethics. Something clicked immediately and forcefully.  I upended my entire life to switch over to a philosophy major, taking negotiated breaks from my job to drive to the required PHIL courses offered only during the day, and then going back to work until late evenings to make up the time. My focus as an undergrad was eclectic; philosophy of science and Husserlian phenomenology consumed me the most. I knew grad school was what I wanted, but to get there I had to ignore the warnings of several senior faculty who advised me kindly but firmly that: A) one simply does not go to grad school to study philosophy of science AND phenomenology, as these are mutually exclusive intellectual passions; and B) one definitely does not try to do so as a woman graduating from what is essentially a commuter university, because you have two strikes against you already. 

With the help of luck, pigheadedness, and some very opportune GRE scores, I managed to worm my way into the Ph.D. program at Boston College, where I thrived. Most fortunate of all was my discovery of a mentor in Richard Cobb-Stevens, possibly the kindest soul I have ever met, and one of the few I could have found who wrote on Husserl and analytic philosophy. He wholeheartedly encouraged my disdain for the arbitrary constraints of the analytic/continental ‘divide.’ I also managed to get a fine education in the philosophy and history of science from I.B. Cohen, who was in the habit of crossing the river from Harvard to teach grad seminars at BC. Virtue ethics was a brand new passion I picked up in grad school. And while I could never make myself love Heidegger the way Bill Richardson wanted me to, I did manage to pick up an interest in the philosophy of technology through a seminar he taught that explored Heidegger’s influence on that field.

I wrote my dissertation on the philosophy of reference in Husserl and the analytic tradition; I was interested in how the former could address some of the challenges of the latter, and I thought this had significant implications for referential practices, ontology and realism in science. I published two pieces from the dissertation in relatively obscure venues (later discovering that one of them somehow made its way into a graduate linguistics course at Stony Brook). Later, I published an article in Inquiry of which I was quite proud, engaging the debate between van Fraassen and Hacking on instrumental realism and scientific ‘unobservables’ from a phenomenological perspective. Another article in Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences took on Dennett’s abuses of phenomenology and the notion of scientific evidence. But once I started on the tenure-track teaching the philosophy of science at Santa Clara University, I quickly realized that trying to publish at the intersections of phenomenology and analytic philosophy of language or science meant fighting a very strong current. Most journals sent back my work without review, saying either that they didn’t publish ‘continental’ work, or that they published only continental work. 

Around the same time, in 2007, I had started teaching a new undergrad course called “Science, Technology and Society,” into which I drew a great deal of philosophy of technology, and some applied ethics. I was dumbfounded by the enthusiastic response of my students, who acted like they had been stranded in the desert and I had just shown up with a water fountain. They were dealing with the advent of smartphones, Facebook, and other new social media, and their relationships and habits were changing in ways they could not fully articulate, but knew were ethically, politically and epistemically transformative. I decided to write something about how new social media were reshaping our communicative habits, and thus almost certainly our communicative virtues and vices. I presented it at a workshop on technology and the ‘good life’ in the Netherlands, where advanced research in technology ethics abounds, and found that my work also resonated among the scholars there; soon after, philosophers and ethicists of technology became my primary research community. 

This was not only for pragmatic, selfish reasons. While I did benefit, tenure-wise, from having a new group of journals that were happy to publish the new kind of work I was doing, I also recognized that my research in the ethics of emerging technologies was of far more immediate social and political importance than the sort of research I had been doing. I told myself that I could return to my phenomenological and epistemological fascinations at any time (and I still do dabble in them), but I reasoned that work on the ethical impact of new media, military and social robotics, artificial intelligence, biomedical enhancement, and pervasive digital surveillance needed to be done now, by as many good philosophers as are equipped and motivated to take it on. Almost a decade has passed since I made that decision, and time has not proved me wrong. As the current President of the [Society for Philosophy and Technology](http://www.spt.org/), Executive Board member of the [Foundation for Responsible Robotics](http://responsiblerobotics.org/), and member of the [IEEE Standards Association’s Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in the Design of Autonomous Systems](https://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/autonomous_systems.html), I have watched the international demand for rigorous research in this area explode.

And yet, philosophy and ethics of technology remains a relatively under-studied and undervalued field in the United States. The problem is not one of social need or interest; being in Silicon Valley, I and many of my peers are invited to speak to policymakers, tech companies and professional groups of software developers, roboticists, and engineers more often than our schedules permit. Yet philosophy departments in the U.S. still employ very few philosophers of technology and tech ethicists, and even fewer in top research positions. In Europe and the U.K., the situation is significantly better, and my research has benefited greatly from a strong network of good friends and research partners in those countries.

I have also been fortunate enough to enter into a great relationship with Oxford University Press, who last year published my first book, the culmination of almost a decade of research into virtue ethics as a normative framework for thinking about emerging technologies: [*Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=us&lang=en&). In the first part of the book, I make the case for virtue ethics as the richest and most adaptable normative framework for crafting a set of global norms and practices that will permit the human family to survive and flourish with new technologies. In the second part of the book, I give the reader a brief tour of the fundamental moral practices of self-cultivation found in three distinct classical virtue traditions: Aristotelian ethics, Confucian ethics and Buddhist ethics, and I show how these practices today can support the contemporary need to cultivate what I call the technomoral virtues. These are virtues of moral character and intelligence that are specifically adapted to the needs of living well with emerging technologies, and to coping with the increasing complexity and opacity of the technosocial future that poses such an acute epistemic challenge to practical wisdom. In the third part of the book, I apply the framework developed in Part Three to four specific domains of emerging technology: new social media, pervasive digital surveillance and self-tracking, military and social robotics, and biomedical human enhancement. The aim of the book is to highlight a practical path to cultivating the technomoral wisdom that can give the human family its best shot at continued flourishing on this planet.

Since the book was written, my work has focused more narrowly on the ethical implications of advances in automation and artificial intelligence. I am happy to have a co-authored chapter with computer scientist George Bekey coming out in a new version of the stellar Robot Ethics volume being edited by Patrick Lin, Keith Abney and Ryan Jenkins, and my next book will devote significant attention to artificial intelligence and its ethical and political implications. I am also increasingly interested in the immense challenges and opportunities that emerging technologies present for the cultivation of civic virtues, and for the democratic flourishing those virtues enable. While the civic virtues of ‘public character’ received significant attention in my first book, I underestimated how quickly our growing deficit of public character would endanger our democratic institutions and our liberties. I expect to be thinking through these challenges for many years to come.

My proof has been verified with the mods of /r/philosophy.

Here are blurbs for each of the Spring 2017 AMA Philosophers:

**Amie L. Thomasson**

[I am](http://thomasson0.wixsite.com/amie-thomasson) a Professor of Philosophy and Cooper Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Miami, soon to be moving to take up a post as Professor of Philosophy at Dartmouth. Lately I have been working largely on questions about the proper value, functions, and methods of metaphysics. I also work on metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of art, philosophy of social and cultural objects, and phenomenology. Earlier in my career I worked a lot on fictional characters, and a lot of my graduate training was in phenomenology. I have published more than 60 articles and three books: [*Fiction and Metaphysics*](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/philosophy/epistemology-and-metaphysics/fiction-and-metaphysics?format=PB) (Cambridge University Press, 1999), [*Ordinary Objects*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ordinary-objects-9780199764440?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2007) and [*Ontology Made Easy*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ontology-made-easy-9780199385119?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2015).

**Samantha Brennan**

[Samantha Brennan](http://samjaneb.tumblr.com/) is a Professor in the Department of Women's Studies and Feminist Research at Western University, Canada. She is also a member of the Rotman Institute of Philosophy and a member of the graduate faculty of the Departments of Philosophy and Political Science. Brennan's main research interests lie in the area of contemporary normative ethics, particularly at the intersection of deontological and consequentialist moral theories. She also has active research interests in feminist ethics.

She is author of over 20 articles and chapters, as well as co-editor of eight books. Brennan is also the co-founder and co-editor of [*Feminist Philosophy Quarterly*](http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/fpq/), an online open access journal in feminist philosophy. She's an active blogger who used to write a lot at the feminist philosophers blog but now mostly posts at [Fit is a Feminist Issue](https://fitisafeministissue.com/), a blog she started with her friend and colleague [Tracy Isaacs](http://tracyisaacs1.tumblr.com/).

**Chris W. Surprenant**

[Chris W. Surprenant](http://chriswsurprenant.com/) is an associate professor of [philosophy at the University of New Orleans](http://www.uno.edu/cola/philosophy/), where I am the founding director of the [Alexis de Tocqueville Project](http://www.uno.edu/tocqueville-project/), an academic center for research and programming focusing on issues at the intersection of ethics, individual freedom, and the law. His work is at the intersection of moral and political philosophy, and his current projects apply this knowledge to contemporary issues in criminal justice reform, including the ethics of punishment; explore the connection between human well-being and entrepreneurship; and examine the influence of the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers on Kant's moral and political philosophy. He has received a handful of awards for his academic work. They include being recognized by Princeton Review in 2012 as one of the ""Best 300 Professors"" in the United States, and by Cengage Learning as one of their ""Most Valuable Professors"" of 2014, awarded to three professors in the United States who ""have made lasting impressions on the education and lives of their students.""

**S. Matthew Liao** 

[I am](http://www.smatthewliao.com/) a philosopher interested in a wide range of issues including ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, moral psychology, and bioethics. I hold the Arthur Zitrin Chair of Bioethics and am the Director of the Center for Bioethics and Affiliated Professor in the Department of Philosophy at New York University.  I am the author of [*The Right to Be Loved*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-right-to-be-loved-9780190234836?cc=us&lang=en&); [*Moral Brains: The Neuroscience of Morality*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/moral-brains-9780199357673?cc=us&lang=en&); [*Philosophical Foundations of Human Rights*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/philosophical-foundations-of-human-rights-9780199688630?cc=us&lang=en&); and over 50 articles in philosophy and bioethics.  I have given TED and TEDx talks in New York and [CERN, Switzerland](http://cern.ch/go/CZ9C), and I have been featured in the New York Times, The Atlantic, The Guardian, the BBC, Harper’s Magazine, Sydney Morning Herald, Scientific American and other media outlets. I am also the Editor-in-Chief of the [*Journal of Moral Philosophy*](http://www.brill.com/journal-moral-philosophy), a peer­-reviewed international journal of moral, political and legal philosophy.

**David Chalmers**

I'm a philosopher at NYU and ANU.  I'm interested in consciousness:
e.g. the [hard problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf)
(see also [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_chalmers_how_do_you_explain_consciousness) TED
talk), the [science of
consciousness](http://consc.net/papers/scicon.pdf), [zombies](http://consc.net/zombies.html), and [panpsychism](http://consc.net/papers/panpsychism.pdf).  Lately I've been thinking a lot about the philosophy of technology: e.g. the [extended mind](http://consc.net/papers/extended.html) (another [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksasPjrYFTg)), the [singularity](http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf), and
especially the [universe
as a simulation](http://consc.net/papers/matrix.pdf) and [virtual reality](http://consc.net/papers/virtual.pdf).  I
have a sideline in metaphilosophy: e.g. [philosophical progress](http://consc.net/papers/progress.pdf), [verbal disputes](http://consc.net/papers/verbal.pdf), and [philosophers' beliefs](http://consc.net/papers/survey.pd).
I help run [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org) and other
online resources.  Here's my [website](http://consc.net/chalmers) (it was cutting edge in
1995) and here's my [life story](http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/david-chalmers/).

**Lisa Bortolotti**

[I am](http://www.lisabortolotti.com/) Professor of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham. I studied Philosophy in my hometown, Bologna, before completing masters at King’s College London and the University of Oxford. I got my PhD from the Australian National University in Canberra. After a research position in Manchester, where I worked primarily on ethical issues emerging from the biomedical sciences, I joined the Philosophy Department at Birmingham. I was awarded the American Philosophical Association Book Prize for [*Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/delusions-and-other-irrational-beliefs-9780199206162?cc=us&lang=en&) (OUP 2009). My latest book is [*Irrationality*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745647839.html) (Polity 2014).

My research interests are in empirically-informed philosophy of mind. I am especially interested in the strengths and limitations of human cognition and my work focuses on some familiar and some more unsettling instances of inaccurate or irrational belief, including cases of prejudice and superstition, self-deception, optimism bias, delusion, confabulation, and memory distortion. I am currently leading a five-year project funded by the European Research Council on [*Pragmatic and Epistemic Role of Factually Erroneous Cognitions and Thoughts* (PERFECT)](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/perfect.aspx), where I ask whether beliefs that are false or irrational can have benefits in terms of bringing about some dimension of success or even furthering agents’ epistemic goals. I argue for the view that there is no qualitative gap between the irrationality of those beliefs that are regarded as symptoms of mental health issues and the irrationality of everyday beliefs. I hope my research and that of my team will contribute to undermining the stigma commonly associated with mental health issues.

In the blog I founded in 2013, [*Imperfect Cognitions*](http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/), academic experts at all career stages and experts by experience discuss belief, emotion, rationality, mental health, and much more.

**Shannon Vallor**

[Shannon Vallor](http://www.shannonvallor.net/) is the William J. Rewak, S.J. Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley. Her areas of specialization are the philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and the ethics of emerging technologies. She is President of the Society for Philosophy and Technology, an executive board member of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, and the 2015 winner of the World Technology Award in Ethics.

Her current research focuses on the impact of emerging technologies, particularly those involving automation, on the moral and intellectual habits, skills and virtues of human beings - our character. Her work investigates how human character is being transformed by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, new social media, surveillance and biomedical technologies, and appears in journals such as *Ethics and Information Technology*, *Philosophy and Technology*, and *Techné*, as well as a 2016 book from Oxford University Press: [*Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=us&lang=en&).

**L.A. Paul**

Some experiences change what you know and understand. In this way, these experiences change you. Some change you so dramatically and so profoundly that they change who you are in some deep and life-altering way. Such experiences transform you. In my recent book, [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), I develop this idea and use it to argue that we can’t rationally control and plan our lives in the way we ordinarily think we can. The idea, at a deeper level, is about the metaphysical structure of the self, and how we can form and construct ourselves through life-changing experiences over time. I’m deeply interested in the nature of transformative experience and what it implies for the rationality of big life decisions, authenticity, and the nature of the self. Related questions I’m working on now include: What is the mind doing when it is disoriented in time? Is it rational to choose to have a chip implanted in my brain and gain a new sense modality? What is the modal and psychological structure of self-deception? How is fear of transformation involved in the fear of having new ideas? What can first person shooter-style computer games and virtual reality experiences teach us about the nature of the immersed self?  

I’m a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. I’m also a Professorial Fellow of the Arche ì Research Centre at the University of St Andrews. My main research interests are in metaphysics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind. I focus my writing on the nature of the self, temporal experience, causation, causal experience, time and time’s arrow, perception, mereology, constitution, and essence. My latest book is [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), published by Oxford University Press in 2014. You can learn more about my research and read or listen to various discussions of it in the New Yorker, The Guardian, The New York Times, the BBC, NPR, and other venues at [www.lapaul.org](http://www.lapaul.org/).

**Jay L. Garfield**

[Jay L Garfield](https://jaygarfield.org/) is Doris Silbert Professor in the Humanities and Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Buddhist Studies at Smith College, Visiting Professor of Buddhist Philosophy at Harvard Divinity School, Professor of Philosophy at Melbourne University and Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at the Central University of Tibetan Studies.  Prof Garfield’s research addresses topics in the foundations of cognitive science and the philosophy of mind; the history of Indian philosophy during the colonial period; topics in ethics, epistemology and the philosophy of logic; methodology in cross-cultural interpretation; and topics in Buddhist philosophy, particularly Indo-Tibetan Madhyamaka and Yogācāra.  

Prof Garfield’s most recent books are [*Minds Without Fear: Philosophy in the Indian Renaissance*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/minds-without-fear-9780190457594?cc=us&lang=en&) (with Nalini Bhushan, 2017), [*Dignāga’s Investigation of the Percept: A Philosophical Legacy in India and Tibet*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dignagas-investigation-of-the-percept-9780190623708?cc=us&lang=en&) (with Douglas Duckworth, David Eckel, John Powers, Yeshes Thabkhas and Sonam Thakchöe, 2016), [*Engaging Buddhism: Why it Matters to Philosophy*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/engaging-buddhism-9780190204341?cc=us&lang=en&) (2015), [*Moonpaths: Ethics and Emptiness*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/moonpaths-9780190260507?cc=us&lang=en&) (with the Cowherds, 2015) and (edited, with Jan Westerhoff), [*Madhyamaka and Yogācāra: Allies or Rivals?*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/madhyamaka-and-yogacara-9780190231286?cc=us&lang=en&) (2015), all published by OUP. Garfield is current working on a book with Yasuo Deguchi, Graham Priest and Robert Sharf, *What Can’t Be Said: Paradox and Contradiction in East Asian Philosophy*; a book on Hume’s *Treatise*, *The Concealed Operations of Custom: Hume’s Treatise from the Inside Out*; and a large collaborative project on Geluk-Sakya epistemological debates in 15th-18th century Tibet following on Taktshang Lotsawa’s *18 Great Contradictions in the Thought of Tsongkhapa* and research with Shaun Nichols on the on the impact of religious ideology on attitudes towards death.


**Kenny Easwaran**

My main work is on formal epistemology and decision theory, with some particular interests in the epistemology of mathematics, and understanding the use of mathematics in describing the world (and particularly in describing our beliefs and decisions).

I started my undergraduate career at Stanford interested in math and music, but after a philosophy of science class and some logic classes, I decided to add philosophy. For my PhD, I attended UC Berkeley's program in Logic and the Methodology of Science, which gave me flexibility to continue advanced mathematical study while preparing for a career in philosophy (though I initially thought I was going to do the opposite). After getting my PhD in 2008, I spent two semesters as a postdoc at the Australian National University, and started a tenure track job at the University of Southern California. In 2014, as my partner was searching for tenure track jobs (he works on nanomaterials for solar energy), we managed to find positions for both of us at Texas A&M University, where I now have tenure.

Most of my work focuses on issues in probability and decision theory, and particularly paradoxes that arise with infinity. One might think that the finitude of our minds means we can only ever consider finitely many possibilities when reasoning about the world. But there are in fact infinitely many ways things could be, and we can implicitly reason about them through our use of language and mathematics, and we never have sufficient information to narrow things down to a finite list of possibilities, unless we ignore the distinctions we can talk about.

I'm happy to answer questions about anything I've worked on, or anything else that sounds interesting. If you want to read some of my work, you can find it all on my website:

"What would computer's need to be considered ""intelligent""?I think I've gotten some clarity about what consciousness is at the level we call ""intelligence"" that I haven't heard discussed or suggested anywhere else yet.

It occurs to me that if intelligence is defined as something like **third person, objective thinking**, then before one can get to being ""intelligent"", one has to first be able to understand a second person's perspective as well as one's own personal, first person, perspective, and then finally be able to experience things from yet a third perspective, all at the same time.  And by ""perspective"" I mean the individual's internal reactions to things (feelings and thoughts, essentially).

This means that for any individual to be truly considered intelligent by a human, it would have to be able to actually experience some event as it is experienced by a human.  So an AI would have to be able to compare that second person ""human"" experience with it's own ""artificial"" first person experience of the same event, and note the differences from a third, ""objective"" perspective.

Of course, even with human to human relationships, the understanding of what someone else's (second person) experience is like is pretty tenuous, at best, but at least with humans, we all have nervous systems that are extremely similar, as well as having mirror neurons, and usually living in the same kind of environment, so we humans have a reasonable chance of getting our assessment of what someone else is feeling and thinking pretty close to source.  But the computers we've designed really don't have anything like our nervous system at all, do they?  I don't see how, as currently designed, even the robots with visual, auditory, and tactile senses that are programmed to ""learn"" in an independent, experimental, and ""evolving"" way will have the ability to experience things in a second person way with humans.

The only way I can see that AI could be truly accomplished from a human perspective would be to first somehow give computers/robots a sense of purpose that's at least similar to the universal human motivations of procreativity (genetic or memetic, aka, physical, artistic, intellectual, or philosophical creative efforts).  And then secondly to give them way to assess the effectiveness of events (sets of inputs and outputs) in moving things toward a specific creative effort, and to have this assessment be done for both their own unique purposes and the unique purposes of another person, at the same time.  In other words, an AI would need to know both ""How am I doing?"", and ""How are you doing?"", and see how those two different states relate to some third person, ""grand scheme"" type of ultimate purpose (presumably a preprogrammed ""morality"" for what is ""right"").

Is there anything I'm missing?  Or does this seem complete with regards to how an artificial intelligence would need to function?"
"The positive aspects of life are instrumental and do not add value beyond their ability to mitigate the negative aspects of lifeFor many people, happiness in itself adds value to life, and happy lives are thus inherently valuable. Indeed, if you ask a crowd what the purpose of their life is, happiness would not be an uncommon answer. However, I don't believe this is the correct interpretation of happiness (along with pleasure, contentment, joy, and all of the various positives that are pursued to some extent by humans everywhere). The value of happiness is not objectively set in stone, but depends on *what people want*. On an individual level, to value something is to have a preference for it over other similar things, and the inverse is true of disvaluing something. If we examine how preferences work, it becomes clear that no amount of happiness can create additional value above and beyond simply the lack of frustrated preferences.

&nbsp;

If I have a preference for shrimp scampi, and I eat it for dinner later tonight, that preference will have been satisfied. The satisfaction of this preference is a positive thing, and feels good when it happens. But suppose I were being spied on over dinner by my neighbor, who simply does not have any preference for shrimp scampi whatsoever. If preference satisfaction adds value compared to the 'baseline' of not having any frustrated preferences, we should expect my neighbor to envy my situation; if only he wanted shrimp scampi, he could be having it right now! 

&nbsp;

Worse yet, think of all the multitudes of dishes he lacks a preference for. Suppose my neighbor is a picky eater, and has no preference for baba ganoush, spanikopita, sushi, or foie gras. He should be overwhelmed with misery for not wanting those things, since he is unable to experience the sensation of eating them after wanting them! Yet, this is not how it works. Not wanting something doesn't put him at a disadvantage compared to somebody who wants it and subsequently gets it.

&nbsp;

[NOTE: it may appear that I am mistaken, and it's possible to envy someone enjoying a dish of food they clearly love; but in that case, the object of my neighbor's preference wouldn't be the dish itself, but the *experience of eating something one finds delicious*. That being established, we could just modify the thought experiment so that he does not have such a preference (which is odd, but not logically impossible), and the objection disappears.]

&nbsp;

My thesis is that all values work this way. All of them can be reduced to preferences that are either satisfied or not. When they are satisfied, your situation inches closer to the baseline of having no frustrated preferences. When they are not, your situation slides away from the baseline. There is no ""higher"" than the baseline, no additional benefit to having more and more satisfied preferences, compared to not having those preferences to begin with. This can be demonstrated via proof by contradiction:


i. (Assumption) Having a preference and then satisfying it is more valuable than never having it.

ii. If having a preference and then satisfying it is valuable, it is something we should want to do.

iii. Something we should want to do is the object of a preference that can either be satisfied or not.

iv. The preference to *have a preference and then satisfy it* is more valuable than never having it.

v. If having a preference and then satisfying it is valuable, it is something we should want to do.

iv. ...

&nbsp;

It's an endless loop. There is no way to justify the value of having satisfied preferences over lack of preferences without invoking further preferences, themselves also in need of justification compared to their absence. My interpretation does not fall into this pit of recursion.

&nbsp;

So, on the topic of life and its purpose, this analysis implies that happiness is not an end in itself, but only a means to the end of getting rid of your frustrated preference for happiness. If you never wanted happiness in the first place, you'd be no worse off than someone who finally gains it. The Buddhists were right: desire is the root of all suffering, and the best possible state isn't the satisfaction of all desire, but the lack of all desire. In this context, life is actually quite tragic. Before we were born, there was a total absence of preference on our part because we simply did not exist. As our lives progress, we pick up desires and aversions, and mistakenly believe getting what we desire is something valuable in itself, something that can outweigh life's sufferings if it happens frequently enough. But if I am correct, the best we can hope for is to achieve the very same absence of desire that obtained during our non-existence prior to birth. 

&nbsp;

[If you disagree, recall that your placing absolute value on getting the things you desire is *itself a desire* (namely, a desire to get what you desire), and you must demonstrate that it is more valuable than its absence. That, of course, can be interpreted as a further desire, creating the infinite regress of justification I mentioned earlier.]

&nbsp;

The existence of any conscious self-aware being is therefore best described as a perpetual accumulation and subsequent removal of the tarnish of preference that was bestowed upon it at birth. There is never any good reason to create more want in the world, when so many wants are currently unmet. All of civilization is the result of a massive compounding of desires upon desires, made more subtle and interesting through cultural and technological advancements, but in the end just preferences whose fulfillment is no more valuable than the nothingness of no culture, no technology, no civilization, and no consciousness at all (the present situation on the planet Jupiter, let's say).

&nbsp;

From a moral standpoint, my view is that we are obligated to reduce the number of unsatisfied wants in the world as best as we are able, but we have no obligation to create additional unsatisfied wants just so that we can reduce their number. On the contrary, since not getting what one wants is a negative experience, we ought not to increase the number of unsatisfied wants. Whether or not this means the end of all humanity is a matter of contention; remember that humans are not the only ones on this planet with preferences. Non-human animals vastly outnumber us, and if we were to voluntarily go extinct, it would leave more room for them to multiply, exponentially increasing the (often quite dire) preferences of wildlife across further generations. 

&nbsp;

Even if we somehow managed to sterilize the globe, it would not erase the possibility that life would evolve again in the distant future, nor would it affect the likely existence of other globes teeming with other kinds of life--which, if conscious, will be teeming with desires and aversions much like our own. On an individual level, one might be morally justified in avoiding procreation, but the view from the population level is harder to resolve one way or another. Prolonging our species' existence in the hope that we can create a technological utopia for all preference-bearing beings is not only a lofty aspiration we haven't even begun enact, but is a clear example of manipulation, of going against Kant's imperative to never treat others merely as tools. There seems to be no morally pure course of action; a possible world that adopts universal antinatalism will not be able to contribute to the reduction of suffering in the animal world or on other worlds, but a possible world that pools its resources to enable a technological solution to suffering may require millennia of untold suffering to reach that point, and it may never succeed before eventually going extinct anyway.

&nbsp;

That's really the end of this line of reasoning, for me. No matter what we do, there is no way to outlive the end of the universe, and whenever that happens, the foregoing arguments have demonstrated that the morally relevant interests of conscious beings will simply revert to the baseline of not wanting or needing anything at all, just as though we had never been. If I'm being speculative, my idea of a perfect future for this universe is one where all civilizations have succeeded in sterilizing themselves and as many of their willing neighbors as possible, by voluntarily refusing to procreate and by using technology to remove the ability to procreate from less intelligent organisms. They would leave behind a fleet of non-sentient robots programmed to prevent conscious life from arising anywhere else in the cosmos. Maybe some of them would stick around in a state of constant bliss, but that's not important; if they just managed to die peacefully with no preferences, there would be no need to manufacture and maintain that bliss. 

&nbsp;

This would all be a monumental undertaking, and is extremely unlikely to ever happen, but even if it did, we may simply be one of an infinite number of possible universes, an infinite number of which have not taken this course of action, and so include an infinite number of frustrated preferences. Or maybe universes are cyclical, so that some mechanism in the 11th dimension starts everything up again from scratch after it peters out in the cold darkness. It could be the same every time, or it could be that each iteration is unique, which would again mean infinitely recurring desires and aversions. If this is the case, we are simply doomed."
"Thoughts on animal sentience and welfare.I think the society is pretty contradictory when it comes to animals.

Let's assume animals are not sentient. It shouldn't matter how you treat a dog anymore than it matter how you treat a dog robot. Neither experience anything, both have just been programmed to yelp when you kick them. Obviously we should just get rid if animal welfare laws and you shouldn't make any distinction between a guy killing a dog and dismantling a robot.

Let's assume animals are sentient. Well now we have pretty big responsibility for not only killing sentient animals, but treating different species completely differently (it's okay to kill livestock but god if you kill a dog you're a monster). Even if we ignore that, the pet owners who put down their old and sickly pets should probably reconsider what they are doing and leave it up to the animal wether it wants to die. Animals are capable of [suicide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_suicide) so I don't see how we have the right to decide for them.

Even when we have philosophical arguments about animal sentience and such, the fact is the way we treat animals is solely based on how intelligent we perceive them to be. Killing an primate would be a lot bigger deal than killing a cow, not to mentian a fly. This is obviously not a good and moral way to base our treatment of animals on. It's easy to imagine a super intelligent alien life who would view as as we view dogs, and have their way with us without our consent and certainly against our will, just because in their view we're that much lower a lifeform."
"Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution.Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution. **[This was written BEFORE the Occupy movement began]**


February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"1 - Philosophical foundations and challenges of AIHello everyone, I’m an undergraduate Philosophy student in my third year. I don’t want to explain all my biography, my desire and my beliefs, so I will get straight to the point. I need to write two important essays in english (that is not my first language, being italian) until the 20th of Dicember and, because a mix of my responsability and of an antiquate academic conception in my country, I’ve never write something so important and so “academic” during my undergrad years, expecially in another language. Because so, I’ve decided to dedicate everyday the first two hours of my study routine to the topic where I’m interested to and I’ve decided to do so following the “rules” of the deliberate practice, studying, writing and thinking acitvely on what I read and looking for constant feedbacks. The topics that I’ve choosed (that are my favourite philosophical topics overall) are the philosophies of Artificial Intelligence, of Cognitive Science and of Mind. Every Sunday I would like to report here a summary of the progress of my studies, trying to explain the basics concepts of the topics that I’ve choose based on my notes and hoping to start a debate on it with other philosophy addicted like me. I’m not an expert, I am not (yet) a Reddit assiduous frequentator, I’m not (yet) a good academic writer and I’m not a native english speaker, so keep in mind these premises when you read my posts. That said, I hope that my posts will be useful as an introduction and as a starting point for a deeper understanding of this crucial issues. 

Ps. These are firsts three books that I have planned to study.

- Artificial Intelligence: The Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intellingence, Keith Frankish and William M. Ramsey (editors)
- Cognitive Science: The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science, Keith Frankish and William M. Ramsey (editors)
- Philosophy of Mind: Philosophy of Mind, Jaegwon Kim

Introduction

The claim of this analysis is to approach the techincal field of the Artificial Intelligence from a philosophical point of view, so without programming or complex mathematical prerequisites. I’m going to be schematic and brief as much as I can, writing here my notes on this book and, for now, more questions that answers, hoping to go deeper in the following weeks thanks also to the comments and discussions. If you noted an error in my style, grammar or in the nature of what I write, please let me know and I’ll correct it as soon as I can, if I agree with your correction.

--

A definition of Artificial Intelligence is complex. I’ve tryied to do that and this is my answer:

- Artificial Intelligence is a) an inorganic agent capable of creative adaptation in different formal or informal context (obejct definition) and b) the studying of the possible implementation strategies of an inorganic intelligent agent (field definition)

Some important questions raised by the field of the Artificial Intelligence are:

- Can a machine think? What does it mean to “think”? Is it possible that exist some differences between different “thinking agent” (a moral agent, a live agent, an organic agent, an intelligent agent, etc.)? 
- Wich is the difference between a Strong AI (an Artificial Intelligence that is identical to a Biological Intelligence) and a -- - Weak AI (an Artificial Intelligence that act like a Biological Intelligence but that is not identical to that)?
- What are the metaphisical assumptions beyond the very idea of the AI? 
- What theory of mind and of psychology fit the best with the ideas at the foundation of the AI? 
- What ethical concerns are raised by the possible emergence of some AI?

1 - Core themes

Some of the most important of AI distinctions, issues, themes and controversies:

- Smart software vs cognitive modeling. Which is the best way to implement an AI, to create and intelligent software that are indipendent from the only intelligence that we know (ours) or to model this softwers on our cognitive functions? To postulate that this difference is inconsistent is to assume that Intelligence is a function indipendent from the material world and to postulate the opposite is to assume an identity between intelligence and the phisycal substratum of the box in which this intelligence is situated (our brain). 

- Symbolic AI vs Neural Nets. Is it possible to reach the AI building a software based on the manipulation of the formal symbols structure of the human thinking or do we focus our attention to the implementation of a model of our brain?

- Reasoning vs Perception. Do we have to build an AI that simulate the thinking process indipendently from the perception or is it necessary that a machine have an internal system of interpretation of the sensory stimulus? 

- How much is important that a machine have the capacity to rapresent the knowledge because we define it sensient and intelligent?

- Brain in a vat vs Embodied AI. Problem aparently solved: the claim was if is it necessary to built a machine that act intelligently but without being embodied in some perceptual system (like the Turing Machine) or if this machine have to interact with the surrounding world directly. The researches, now, are focused on the embodied AI.

- Narrow AI vs human-level intelligence. Is it possible to implement a Strong AI (that IS like the human brain) or is it only possible to built a Weak AI (that ACT intelligently, but that is different from the human intelligence)?

2 - Philosophical foundation and challenges

An important question: does an AI have to simulate the high level cognitive processes of the human brain (logic, deduction, inference, symbols manipulation, etc) or is it better to built first a bottom-up system that start to learn this processes from the lower level perceptual abilities? The first claim is the one supported by the GOFAI view (Good Old Fashon AI): they prefer the faster way, that is to model the best system of intelligence that we know, ours. The second is the one supported by the Embodied AI: we have to build an evolutionary system, starting from the creation of a basic simulation af an artificial organism and following it during its evolution.

The Turing Test was the first attempt to imagine how we can determine if a machine is intelligent or not: it postulate that we can understand if a system is intelligent or not just by an evaluation of its linguisti ability and of its behaviour. This is the behavioural-GOFAI vision of the AI. A new version of the Turin Test postulate that we have to integrate to this two criteria the ability of this machine to interact with the surrounding ambient. This is the vision of the Embodied AI.

It is a general belief that an AI could not think abductively, namely it could not generate conjections from some premises. This creative way of thinking is claimed to be one of the higher human ability, and who follow this argument think that a machine that could only follow a set of rules cannot think outside this rules and formulate new conjecture. This is the problem of relevance: a machine seem to couldn’t have an olistic approrach to reality, so that is impossible for her to understand when an information is relevant or when it is not. But what does it mean that only an embodied system could act intelligently? Is it maybe that there is a necessary relation between the body and the function?

Computational theory of mind. This theory is based on the assumption that when an agent think he follow a set of basic and atomic blocks of meaning, that are symbols that one could reproduce in an algorithmic system. Mental states, so, are just a composition of different blocks of meaning. But what is the foundation of this blocks? How can we have this language of thought? Is it based on what? Three possible answers of these questions: 1) informational theory: if a quantity of x change in the same time of a quantity of y so this two quantity are related; so if a mental state change when in brain there is a changing in the quantity of y the mental state is related to the brain changes; 2) evolutive theory: mental state are adaptation, useful to survive, and the meaning associated to these state are only evolution tricks for surviving; 3) conceptual-role semantics: the meaning of a linguistic fact is based on the social meaning associated to this fact. 

A critic to the Turing test: it is possible that someone build a Turing machine that seem to be intelligent because speak like an human, but it speek like that only because someone program it in that way. It could seem similare to the old argument of Lady Lovelace: one could program a machine to talk an human language but this machine could only follow the rules programmed by the programmer, never become conscious of the real meaning of the language that it speak (the Searle’s Chinese Room Argument say a similar thing, and I’m going to talk of that in a specific topic)

What is the relation between purpouse/intentionality/consciousness and AI? It could be that someone built a machine that have a mental state (AI)Purpose' correspondent to (Human)Purpose, relating a vast range of (AI)IntentionalMentalState' to (Human)IntentionalMentalState. Searle reject this view arguing that a Machine could only posses a sintax, not a semantic (meaning that a robot have an algoritmic language and human have a non-deterministic language?).

Difference between mechanism and rationality: beeing rational mean to act according to some (general) rules, beeing mechanic mean to act according to some instruction taht could violate the general rules. This is a reproposition of the problem of relevance: a rational beeing could understand when an information is relevant under the light of some evidences indipendently of the instruction, whereas a mechanical engine could only understand what someone told him to be relevant.

The godelian argument is very complex, but I understand something: any formal system is proved by Godel to be inconsistent or incomplete and being a mechanism based on some type of a formal system, one coud conclude that an AI is to be incomplete or inconsistent. The problem is that following this argument one could doubt the godelian theorem himself, because it is based on the thinking of another formal system, the mind of a mathematician."
The Ethics of Saving Lives With Autonomous Cars Are Far Murkier Than You Think
"What will be the future trends in philosophy?I'm relatively new to philosophy, switching into the major from engineering and various liberal arts areas. But I think it suits me really well, and I'm seriously considering grad school to become an academic in the field.

I'm curious about where you guys think philosophy will go in the future. What will our current trends lead into?

I think it's pretty obvious that robot/AI ethics will expand in the near future. I also think quantum physics and cosmology will lead to new theories of dualistic/spiritual metaphysics. "
"My friend and I exchange philosophical epistles to stay in touch.This one is ""On Evil""I’ve decided to write to you today, to discuss something that has been weighing quite heavily on my mind. I won’t pretend to be doing so with selfless motives; I enjoy this sort of talk, and I always jump at the chance to hone my writing abilities.

Since I have just spoken of “honing my writing abilities”, I will not allow myself an irresponsibly decorated introduction.

I am writing to you, dear friend, to discuss the Argument of Evil, and while I am well aware that you know the details of this argument, I will still summarize it in my own colloquial words. 

The world is full of murderers, rapists, liars, and villains of all sorts. Innocent children are murdered every year. People experience sorrow and pain of unfathomable intensity on a daily basis all throughout the world, and throughout the history of life itself. 
If someone COULD prevent such horror, especially at no cost to themselves, they would have the highest moral obligation to do so.  If someone cannot prevent these tragedies, then that person is not omnipotent.
If a god exists, then he is either impotent or evil.

This is the basic argument you will hear brought against the notion of god(or at least a benevolent god). My intention in this letter is not to defend the argument from evil, but rather to express my dissatisfaction with the best theological objections to it. 

It is so easy to allow emotion to commandeer ones faculties, and cause one to forsake clarity of thought, so I will try my best to avoid this perennial pitfall.

In my younger years, I never gave this argument much credit. I could dismiss it easily in a number of ways. As I aged, and I became exposed to the philosophies of academic Christians, my arsenal of responses to the problem of evil steadily increased. For the sake of convenience I will list the most common responses to the problem of evil below.

1.) Bad things happen to allow good things to come of them. I.E. ""When God closes one door he opens another"".

2.) God works in mysterious ways. (""We can't possibly understand why God does the things he does so let's just assume they are good"") This relates to the first argument but is slightly different.

3.) Bad things happen to remind us that we are sinful and must worship God. (""God made 9-11 happen to punish America for sinfulness"") A famous accusation of the late and not great Jerry Falwell.

- This next one is far and above the most sophisticated-

4.) God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

- The first argument can be discarded merely because of it’s blatant appeal to the future, and the third can be ignored because of its downright barbarism, as well as its inconsistency(Since it would require all non-Christian countries to suffer God’s wrath). 

The second and the fourth, however, have some value. 

The 2nd argument is obviously an appeal to ignorance, and yet I will give it a proper response because of it’s frequent use by noted apologists. I read an essay by the eminent Christian philosopher William Lane Craig on the problem of evil, and after suffering through his trademark wordiness, I saw that he was unable to avoid this appeal to ignorance.

He explain that as “finite, limited beings” we cannot possibly fathom the timeless, infinite God of the universe.

Forget, for a moment, how irritating this common religious response is, and look at it through the lense of your greatest ally; Reason. 

In general, the Christian responses to the argument from evil are always arguments of unavoidable victory. This means that they frame things in such a way so that if something good happens, it is God’s doing. However when something terrible happens, it is attributed to the mystery of God, or perhaps even the mischief of Old Nick. Victory is unavoidable.

This sort of thought reminds me of a passage from Voltaire’s Candide, which I will provide below.

“You see,” said Candide to Martin, “that crime is sometimes punished; that rascal of a Dutch captain met the fate he deserved.”
“Yes”, said Martin, “but was it necessary that the passengers on his ship should perish also? God punished that knave, the devil drowned the others”

Voltaire, with his merciless wit, rightly mocks this sort of childish thought. The idea that all good things are attributed to God, and all bad things find ownership elsewhere, is embarrassingly transparent and should not be given a second thought by the intellectually honest thinker.
 
We now move on to the most compelling rebuttal to the argument from evil, the 4th argument.

God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

I first heard this argument put forth by prominent Cambridge mathematician and apologist John Lennox. Lennox has been referred to as the “closest thing to a modern C.S. Lewis”, and is a rare example of a respected Christian Scientist( A Christian who is a scientist, not the outrageous hallucinations of Mary Baker Eddy). He used the 4th argument in a debate with Christopher Hitchens, and I felt as though his argument was not properly scrutinized. Here is the link to their debate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH68Y5MUGfo

The reason Lennox’s argument went uncontested is because Hitchen’s actually shares this belief. In Hitchens' book Letters to a Young Contrarian, he attacks the idea of universal accord, and states that disagreement is what makes life worth living. He explains how dull and meaningless a world would be where there is no contrary thought or competing ideas. Hitchens didn’t think to contest Lennox’s argument because he holds the same belief. This, I believe, caused him to miss the problem with Lennox’s idea.

If you haven’t seen the glaring contradiction in Lennox’s argument yet, I will not delay any longer in revealing it to you. 

Lennox claims that a world without any pain, or any disagreement, would be a robotic world in which love, peace, and happiness mean nothing. That without their opposites they have no definition. The problem is that the Christian doctrine idealizes this very type of world in the concept of heaven. Christians yearn for an Eternal Paradise where there is no sorrow or suffering. They “take no thought for the morrow” because Christ will undoubtedly return in their lifetimes. To Christians, this life is simply passing scenery on the path to paradise. The core Christian belief in heaven directly contradicts the 4th argument. 

I happen to agree that a Nirvana of this sort is as inconceivable as it is undesirable. A place where all people share the same opinions, and dissension is nowhere to be found, is not a place that I would want to exist in even if it were a possibility. It would be robotic, unconscious, and inhuman.

The problem for Christians is that the Bible does not agree with this sentiment, and so the 4th argument cannot be used by those Bible believing Christians who so love to use it.

The notion of heaven is the key to dismantling the 4th argument.

I am an agnostic who is quite friendly to the idea of Deism, and so I am not entirely convinced by the argument of evil. I look forward to hearing your thoughts dear friend, and I hope they will bring some clarity to this most difficult topic. 

Warmest regards to you and your family.

"Mother Theresa More of a Threat than Hitler“Our democratic freedoms are just as much in peril from those who are ethically motivated as they are from those who are driven by greed and personal ambition”. 

The modern day philosopher Peter Singer goes on to argue that “in fact since we are more on guard against the latter, the danger from the former may be the greater”. 
It is of great concern that the ethically motivated may pose a greater threat to us than those clearly marked evil. It is of even greater concern that it seems that most philosophies moral codes and rational thoughts can be bent twisted and distorted to make the most evil of acts seem justified.  

Look at the noble task of trying to create utopia and what that lead to when the Khmer Rouge tried to create an agrarian utopia resulting in millions being killed in Cambodia. Karl Popper argued that trying to achieve an utopian society can lead to violence as the view people have of utopia differ and to keep people marching to the same vision when rationality does not work violence may have to be employed.  

Even a moral code for Robots such as Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics that forbids them from harming humans can be perverted. 

In the movie I Robots the robots enslave the human race and their justification for doing so, humans are self-destructive {hard to argued with that} and so they are protecting humans here from themselves by enslaving them. They are in fact keeping within the three laws just as good people tell themselves when they are doing evil.    

The commandants of any religion or secular society are unlikely to guarantee a moral crusader stays moral. Even a blanket ban on certain acts like thou shalt not kill does not encompass all. If one cannot kill what about torture starving deprivation of liberty is that permissible? What about killing in self-defense what of pre-emptive self-defense get them before they get you? Is war ever right what about the just war theory that says it is sometimes? 

Utilitarianism that commands us to do the greatest good for the greatest number can justify a great amount of suffering for the minority. 

What if one has a blanket ban on suffering itself to ensure the moral crusader does not do more harm than good?  

What if the suffering is needed now to alleviate greater pain later such as the government making tough financial decisions now to ensure the country has the budget to provide vital services down the track? 

What of the true story of 127 hours. Where a climber had to break his arm to get free? If it is okay to produce that suffering to save his life why not break a few Jewish arms or black arms or female arms or capitalistic or communist arms to help save the lives of a great number of people.  

What if we rely on common sense our ability to rationalize to guide our moral crusader? People usually good people have argued that dropping the A- Bomb on civilians was acceptable during WW2 removing children from Aboriginal parents in Australia without consent torturing terrorists collateral damage from drone strikes toppling democratically elected governments in South America banning gays from getting married following Martin Luther King Jr with non-violence or Malcolm X with violence in the fight for civil rights.

This is not an argument about not doing good? The world needs more good and not the basic level of good given by people who sign up to a philosophy of just being good to their friends and family. This factory setting type of good that some subscribed to is surely not enough. Given the importance of the virtue of doing good caring about the disadvantaged a basic level of good or incidental good that occurs only if one passes by someone in need is not enough. 

Given the misery out there in world also surly means a slightly higher level of good is required. One does not have to take on the responsibility of alleviating all suffering in the world but one does have to take on some of the responsibility which requires more than just factory level settings of good.  

But how to ensure the do goers are not going to pose as much of a threat to humanity as evil doers? Karl Popper recommends tackling concrete evils as opposed to boosting happiness. For utopia is different for different people whereas most people agree to concrete evils out there that need to be abolished such as global poverty.  

Tackling something like poverty does not require murder or deprivation of liberty or human rights abuses. Providing a better job, affordable child care a better education system does not require media suppression and other Orwellian policies disappearances or a benevolent dictator to see it through.

A modern check and balance on our moral crusader may be if their efforts result in Wikileaks featuring their work then you have got a problem. If it requires you to deny publicly what one is doing or shred evidence to lose sleep at night that may be a sign that the policeman not the criminal in the cell is the greater danger. If one appears on 60 minutes in an unfavorable light one may need to step back from the brink.  

Tackling preventable diseases does not require a tyrant or hero who becomes a tyrant nor does it require unrestricted capitalism or socialism and Stalin’s portrait in the lobby. It requires things like affordable health care distribution systems to get medicines to those that need them and taxing smokes to reduce the smoking rate but what of tackling violent crime like murder?

This is a concrete evil that could see the use of deprivation of liberty torture freedom of expression and movement to keep people safe justified and so how does one stop good people doing bad things?  

Effectiveness not logic or morals might be a good benchmark to use when tackling crime. A well done randomized trial could answer the question once and for all. If the great philosophers in history used a randomized trial to answer the big questions then philosophical discussions may have ended in the time of Ancient Greece. 

If the aim is to reduce crime as oppose to look merely as though one is than effective programs need to be carried out not breaches of human rights. Reducing demand for drugs to help stop the drug wars better pay for cops to reduce corruption, lock outs for pubs not prohibition to tackle the high amount of violence created by alcohol. Reducing poverty and these crimes like human trafficking and piracy in which poverty contributes greatly to their existence.

Dealing with mental illness to reduce gun related violence in places like the United States. These require not a dictatorship or oppression or martial law and maybe not even gun control. What it requires is allocating funds to effective programs. Helping to support Imams spread moderate Islam does not require drone strikes and holding people without charges.   

Tackling these concrete evils in this way does not require an internal struggle between what you are doing and what you should be doing. It does not require any of the human rights enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights to be breached. It does not require good people becoming as evil as the people they sought to defeat. It does not require it turning out like Orwell’s Animal Farm where the animals toppled their brutal and greedy masters only to become like them or to twist moral codes. 

All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others. 
One philosophy above others that is worth remembering is that I could be wrong on my take on good and evil and what is permissible. I say this to warn not just you but myself to ensure I don’t become so sure that I am right while everyone else is wrong that I am good while others are evil. 

Maybe we should add to Edmund Burke’s quote the only necessary thing for the triumph for evil is for good men to do nothing…….or to become as evil as the men they are trying to stop.

"The Possibility of Knowing Thyself: Impressions, Triangulation and why Theories aren't Subjective**Thesis** Part of the reason philosophy exist. Part of the reason philosophy developed naturally. Part of the reason philosophy continues to persist is that it answers some questions that are otherwise unanswerable. These questions take over the limits of science and art, yet we wish to talk about them. And beyond science and art, we can only talk about these subjects in a philosophical manner.

""Philosophical manner"" meaning that philosophical answers aim to answer questions about objectivity and subjectivity without trivializing either one.

One of the question is not so much a direct question but a commandment from one of western philosophy's founding member: Socrates. Socrates directed his followers to know thyself indirectly by the famous dictum: The Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living.

That is, the life you live and are living right now is not worth anything unless you examine it. Like gold in itself is worthless unless you know what properties it has. And you can only know the properties of gold by examining it.

In this post I aim to talk about the framework all humans find themselves in in this endeavor as we seek to find ourselves and make our lives worth living and how we can discover the properties that enrich our lives.
_____________________________________
**Part {1}**

You're an idea. 

Or rather an idea is essential to your being.

Try to exist without having an idea on your mind. This may arguably be possible, for example, through sleep or meditation. But other than in special circumstances, wherever you go you go with an idea on your mind.

The only way to start off defining yourself is going through the idea barrier. Without an idea you cannot exist. To prove you exist, you need an idea first.  

___________________________________

**Part {2}**

To be something is to be that. 

So whatever you are is a reference to what you are. But to make a reference to what you are you have to be something that is referenced or capable of being referenced. 

To reference means to point to something. When you're referencing yourself you're pointing at yourself.

You cannot, however, just point to yourself and find yourself. It's like saying ""A is A"". An ""A"" is worthless without knowing its properties, its relations to other letters, or how it can benefit/enrich you from using it. 

If you point at something that is you, you have to be both the subject and the object in question.

You have to be (1) something that is subjectively evaluating an objective thing and you have to be (2) an objective thing that is being referenced.

___________________________________
**Part {3}**

When we reference an apple, we first get an apple and call it an apple. Then we compare an apple to what an apple is not.

If the apple is red, then we say that the apple is red. But the apple is red because it's not any other color.

The positive and negative qualities are intimately tied. Just because the apple is not blue doesn't mean it's yellow. The apple is both red and not blue. It's not just not (any color but red). The apple is red and not (any color but red).

Why an apple is red can be explained or reasoned in many different ways:

1. We can talk about lights waves 
2. apple genetics 
3. the climate that allowed for red apples to emerge 
4. the environment that favored red apples to continue existing vs different color apples that may have gone extinct or never given a chance to flourish 
5. our vocabulary that says ""red means this particular phenomena"" and an apple that adheres to that definition (""An apple is red because red it word we use to describe the phenomena that the apple is exhibiting"")
6. Etc

Some of these truths are absolutely true no matter the context. Light waves and apple genetics may be true for everyone and everything; regardless if they can understand the concept or not. 

When it comes to vocabulary, we may transfer truths to one another using words but only if those words are grounded in truth AND we agree on the meaning of the words.

We could have a debate that seems contradictory. One side may argue that the apple is red and another that it's blue. And they may both be right if their use of the word correspond to the same phenomena. 

The important or relevant thing to take away from this is that:

1. our portal towards truth depends on our impression of the world.
2. our impression must be neutralized to reach objectivity. 
3. our impression of the world and absolute truth are indistinguishable/inseparable (our impression of everything and anything is founded/reasoned through truths that exist independent of our impressions and that in itself is a truth)
4. our impression of the world is a mixture of truth and subjectivity

We can remove our personal subjectivity in order to concentrate truth (science) or we can indulge in our subjectivity (art). This isn't relevant but your day to day life is probably a somewhat balance between the two.

_______________________________________________
**Part {4}**

To know thyself is to concentrate the truth of your subjectivity. 

Let's say you're colorblind so that an apple I call red you see as forest green. You would live with subjective truths that are based on impressions that may include:

1. It's difficult for you to distinguish between forest green plates and red apple slices laying on top of the plate
2. There are colors that other people can see that you can't
3. There's something in your body that affects the impression you have of the world that results in not seeing things other people see
4. You don't know and can't know the impression non-colorblind people have of red apples

Everything I said in the first half of **Part {3}** can be known by the colorblind person and everything I listed here can be known by the non-colorblind person.

That's because the lists are ideas commenting on truths. They are ideas that beg the question with goal of justifying them. They are ideas that presuppose a foundation for reality. But the ultimate justification is your impression. Not the actual absolute truth that exist independent of you; since its only value is your dependence of it. And your dependence of it is based on impressions.

That's why any scientific question can lead to an ad infinitum ""why"" until it's stopped by ""well that's how far science has gotten us thus far"" or ""well, that's a different field of study."" Although science is humanity's best hope to cure diseases, stabilize inequality, end suffering, and create technological advancement. This isn't criticism or lampooning science. Since each discipline/gaze/etc is limited in scope and science is no exception.

Ideas that comment on truths are called theories or hypothesis. But not all ideas comment on truths. And not all truths need to be unearthed or discovered. Some truths are self-evident. For example, our impression is self-evident and true. And yet our impression of the world begs the question because it's an idea that instinctively and instantly comments on further truth that are not self-evident. 

We can then contribute to the impression of the world through art. Or we can deduce our impression of the world through science.

Necessarily, art carries with it scientific truths that can be uncovered and at the same time scientific truths affect our perspective of our art and artistic unfolding. So even the illusion of removing subjectivity is merely an illusion.

________________________________
**Part {5}**

I'm not a dualist. I favor a threesome perspective. That is founded on triangulation.

To know yourself you first have to find yourself. And as with any mathematical problem or navigation, you need at least two knowns or two coordinates to find yourself. 

I would argue that to find and know thyself you need absolutely need two broad coordinates: Absolute Truth and you. 

The difference between the two is that while you're founded on absolute truth, absolute truth is impermeable. You're not impermeable. You're tainted by subjectivity. You are a changing thing based on the changing universe. It's true that sometimes you're cold and sometimes you're hot. Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad. You regard some things as morally good and other things as morally bad. And what those things are sometimes change and sometimes they don't. But all of it is based on absolute truth. 

Change is part of absolute truth. Everything changes constantly. Any impression of the physical world being stagnant or stationary is an illusion based on impressions. Based on truth and subjectivity. 

It's like a video game that changes maps. The buttons you press are always the same to achieve the desired results.

There may be games that change the button layout each map so that you have to re-adjust, but there is still a foundation of truth that guides the change. There's still an objective. You cannot play a game without there being an objective. Regardless if the objective is created by the game creators or yourself. To move, to think, to do requires a plane where you can triangulate yourself. Whether that's space and time or morality or a video game.

Ultimately, to know thyself is to be aware of how you define what you define. Because the part of you that is based on absolute truth is unchanging and consistent. But it's not physical. It's based on principles that transcend the physical since its properties are evident but inconsistent with how the physical behaves.

______________________________________
**Counterarguments**

On whether **Part {1}** is just Cartesian skepticism: I'm not saying that the physical world can be trivialized or that your ideas take precedence to the physical world. I'm saying that as soon as you start talking, you're bringing an idea to life. You cannot talk or think or exist without bringing an idea to life. Even if you exist without thought there's no way to know you exist because to know you exist is a thought. 

The idea itself can be like a plant that sprouts. We can investigate the origins of the plant and its makeup or we can analyze the plant itself. But you cannot start to talk without there being an idea associated. Your words and thoughts are part of the nutrients that give the plant life, among other things.

One may argue ""what if we program a robot to say 'I exist' or 'I am'"".

I think this goes back to the fundamental question of how can you know thyself.

Doing one of those fancy European philosophy moves we can see it another way. The euro step? No that's basketball. I mean the flipping something on it's head in a very French way.

Asking ""what happens if a robot says 'I exist'"" is the same thing as saying what happens when a rock says ""I exist"" or if another human says ""I exist.""

We can only know they exist insofar as we can see they exist (either artistically or scientifically). The same thing when you yourself say ""I exist."" You exist insofar as you can see yourself.

You see yourself when you express yourself. Sometimes you express yourself and only you can see the expression. Or sometimes you express yourself but only you have the perspective you have (since each person has their own perspective). Either way, you can simultaneously express yourself and see yourself since your perspective is a further expression of you. 

Although usually we express ourselves first and after a while reflect on ourselves. 

In short, we can deduce an existential being exist or not (and in what ways it exists) based on pragmatism. And that pragmatism can be led by science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two. 

Concerning ""science inquiry, artistic impression, or a balance between the two,"" we naturally combine both. Furthermore, we can't influence one part without influencing the other. But this unfolding also feeds into who you are and what you can reflect on.

It's bad philosophy to introduce a concept at the end (such as pragmatism) but moving on, your being observes the universe. Your being is indirectly observing absolute truth. And our subjectivity shines a light on different truths that depend on our subjectivity.

We can put our subjectivity aside by cancelling it out in theory and militarize pragmatism in a scientific context and discover ""objective truths"" but even without doing this, your subjectivity runs into objective truths all the time. It's just that our subjectivity measures truth less accurately than science. Although to an equally true degree. 

The only way to measure truth more accurately is through pragmatic effort, then. To DO something first and see what results. Evaluate what you see. Whether it's something artistic or scientific or if it's evaluation artistically or scientifically. To do something, anything, and then to triangulate that something with absolute truth to find yourself. Yourself being a union of the two and thus a triangulation of who you are. If we are to equate who you are with where you are. But finding where you are is the first step of finding thyself. 
"
"A little question about free willAccording to determinism, external causes from our surrounding environment determine our actions. This is why we are not ""free"" and there is no ""will"".

According to non-determinism, that doesn't happen like that. Certainly there are external causes around us, but they don't determine our actions; there isn't an ultimate connection between those environmental causes around us, and our actions as a consequence of those causes. So our actions remain ""causeless"", and therefore an internal ""free will"" within our brain must exist that provides with the lacking but necessary cause for our actions. Of course, non-determinism can't negate the obvious, visible fact that environmental causes around us physically affect us; therefore non-determinism needs to provide with some image or idea that manages to reconcile the contradictory facts that there is no ultimate connection between external environmental causes and human actions, while being obvious and visible that external environmental causes physically affect humans. At this point non-determinism imagines that external environmental causes are necessary for our human actions, but they are not sufficient, so a human ""will"" or ""wish"" is necessary too, and exists, for the action to be executed.

And I was wondering if we could consider the following way of reconciling the deterministic idea that *only* external causes motivate our actions, with the non-deterministic idea that, in addition to those external causes, an internal will or wish is necessary too for our actions:

External environmental causes motivate certain processing within our neurons (this processing will be, in turn, the basis that will give rise to our subsequent action). ***We psychologically experience and feel that neurological processing happening inside of us, motivated by the external causes, and that give rise to our subsequent action, as ""wish to do"", ""will to do"", ""own predisposition to do"", ""responsibility"", ""freedom"", ""choice"", etc***

There's another consideration to add: as we don't have yet a perfect scientific knowledge about all the specific details of those neurological processes that happen within our brain as a consequence of the external environmental causes, then we might also experience and feel that lack of detailed knowledge about the neurological basis of our action as things like ""wish"", ""will"", etc.

I'd like to know your opinion about these ideas, thanks in advance.

----------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------


**EDIT 1 :** regarding free will in Buddhist philosophy, I'd like to add the following model introductions:

Consider that there is a natural physical world around us, and we want to rationally research on what should be our ""optimal actions or movements"" within that natural world (these ""optimal actions or movements"" based on the natural physical world around us would require to acquire the scientific knowledge about that natural world's geography and topological configuration, resources, etc, and to develop mathematical calculations and scientific determinations for planning our ""best"", ""optimal actions and movements"" within that natural world around us). Now consider that our ""rationally scientifically optimal actions and movements"" within the natural world around us, could be thought as some sort of ""transparent layer"" displaying an imaginary *""plan, draft or map of optimal actions and movements""*, similar to imaginary lines, within the natural environment given to us. In this sense, our ""optimal actions and movements"" can be thought as ""already being out there"", given the conditions of the natural physical environment around us.

Now, let's use the following terminology: let's qualify those ""scientifically optimal actions and movements within the given environment"" as ""right actions"" or ""correct actions"" (clearly, these right actions are determined by the surrounding natural environment); and let's qualify all the rest of non-optimal and imperfect actions and movements as ""wrong actions"".

Initially, all our actions and movements within the given natural environment (imagine a desert island) will be ""wrong"", but, as we study and research into that unknown environment, we finally determine what are the best, ""optimal actions and movements"".

So, my question is: *could those initial ""wrong actions"" motivated by the lack of knowledge about the environment, be considered as our ""free will""? That is, in other words: is ""free will"" only the set of all our ""wrong actions"", which are based on the initial inexistence of knowledge about the surrounding environment? is free will only the set of all our wrong, ignorance-based (sensory limitations-based, etc) actions?*

By scientific research and knowledge you become an agent that doesn't need free will, because you have already got the external determiners and references for your (optimal, correct, right, non-free) actions. (In other words, by scientific research and knowledge you become a ""robot"", a ""mechanism"", whose actions and movements are ***determined*** by the surrounding environment, and that, so, doesn't need free will).

From this point of view, ""living free"" is only ""living in the ignorance of the external causes of your actions"". As you don't know the external causes of your actions (but you perform those actions), then you get the impression that you yourself *""randomly"" (without known external cause, ""freely"")* cause those actions."
"Transhumanism - Your thoughts, emotions, fears, inhibitions? And how long will we remain human? What does it mean to BE human?Hello r/philosophy,

I'd like to take a few minutes to open a discussion regarding transhumanism, or the integration of cybernetics/technology with our own biology, and open up a venue for fellow lurkers to present viewpoints for and against it. I can't control anyone else, but I promise I'll respect your opinions as long as you respect my own.

One of the great minds on the forefront of such ideas is **Ray Kurzweil**, a futurist, author and inventor who has spent 30+ years studying a behavior coined ""*exponential growth*,"" in which technology and our understanding of it and our own biology does not statically grow from one stage to the next, but increases by exponential rates every year. Here are some thoughts of his:

>*""By 2029, we’ll have reverse engineered and modeled and simulated all the regions of the brain. And that will provide us the software/algorithmic methods to simulate you know, all of the human brains capabilities including our emotional intelligence. And computers at that time will be far more powerful than the human brain. And we’ll be able to create machines that really do have subtlety and suppleness of human intelligence. And they’ll combine that power with ways in which machines are already superior to us. They can impart us all of human knowledge with the few keystrokes, it can remember billions of things accurately. They can share knowledge in electronic speeds that are million times faster than the human language.""*

>*""...20 years, 25 years, these nanobots, these blood cell size devices will be going in our bodies keeping us healthy from inside. We’ll have some go inside our brains to the capillaries not invasively, there would be interacting with our biological neurons so it’ll extends our memory, our decision making faculties, put our brains on the internet and they also enable us to enter virtual reality environment from within the nervous system.""*

Another pioneer in the venture of Cybernetics is [Kevin Warwick](http://bigthink.com/ideas/39801), the first *human cyborg*. Professor Warwick, with artificial implants, was able to control a mechanical hand thousands of miles away by ""jacking his nervous system into the internet."" He has also done extensive research into biological-robotics, including a small robot with a ""brain."" Warwick is convinced that man must integrate with machine in order for us to survive and evolve as a species.

**Some other questions I have:**

* When will we have reached the point in which we are no longer *human*? If technology consist of tools created by humans to extend our own human abilities, how are these *not* human?

* For those of faith, do you believe it an *abomination* or an *act against God* to pursue the halting of biological death, or at least postponing it? Do you believe that we are meant to accept death as a part of life, and to attempt to stop that is, essentially, an affront against what we were ""meant"" to experience?

* When do you think AI will be created, if ever? Furthermore, what is your definition of AI? Some, like myself, would argue that we already have narrow, ""primitive"" AI within our everyday lives.

* Does the thought of SkyNet happening scare you?

* What are some possible ethical/moral laws and regulations that should be put into place as we move into the integration of cybernetics and human biology?

* I believe the most important question, though, is very simple: what does it mean to be *human*?

**TL;DR: SkyNet: Yay or nay?**

*I know that there are a lot of people that may not agree with the people/sources I've mentioned in this post, but that doesn't mean that we cannot discuss the possibilities for our coming future and the transition into technological mastery. I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of this.*

EDIT: I just realized there are already two or three threads dealing with technology and AI. I promise, I wasn't attempting to piggy-back off of these ideas."
"Ethics in a Post Apocalyptic Setting - A What-If Scenario for Fun!I'm reposting this from /r/gaming because I'm curious how /r/philosphy redditors would answer this in their own subreddit. 

I've played Fallout: New Vegas a number of times now, and I love how many moral choices you're presented with throughout. However, I've noticed myself doing a lot of meta-gaming when it came to how I solved problems. I think this is natural and a lot of people playing a game want to make the decision that ultimately helps them the most (gets them items, money, xp). Whatever role playing they may have considered when creating their character is basically out the window when making decisions of this nature. 

I would like to attempt a pure role playing play-through of New Vegas, but I think it would help a lot to establish what kind of behaviors I'm allowed prior to beginning so I don't have to make shit up as I go along. Much as our society (the Old World) has a moral code of what most people find acceptable behavior, so must a setting like New Vegas. However, these are not always going to match up with Old World values for obvious reasons. Example, if today you found a dead body in the middle of the street, it would not be proper to loot the dead body. It would be considered tampering with a crime scene, etc... However, if placed in a post-apocalyptic world of radiation, starvation, and roaming gangs of violent criminals being *the norm*, I'm pretty sure you or I would not bat an eye at rifling through the deceased's belongings.

So, now that you know what I'm talking about, lets come up with some fairly universal rules of acceptable behavior for survivors wandering the Mojave desert. Forget what the game rewards Karma for, we're not trying to make a saint, we're trying to describe basic practices accepted as necessary for survival. I'll start!

**A)** Responding to any threat of violence with violence is acceptable (there is no public justice system in place to punish someone for assault, rape, or murder)

**B)** Shooting first (sneak attack) when a threat is implied (wild animals, raiders, killer robots) is acceptable 

**C)** Taking anything with no obvious owner (shop keeper, etc...) is acceptable

These are the easy and obvious rules, pre-requisites to basic survival in the Mojave and New Vegas. The bigger questions that need addressed are things like, is Caesar's Legion right? Why? Is it really better to be independent (Yes Man path) or does humanity's best hope of survival actually lie in joining the New California Republic? Or, since Mr. House saved New Vegas during the final hours of the Old World, does he deserve to continue to rule it? Consider these questions from a wasteland ethics perspective and how that would answer them, not your own personal ethics.

Let us get into this!

Other example areas of discussion:

Is there value in salvaging Old World tech, or would this eventually lead to a repetition of what destroyed the Old World? (this is the Brotherhood of Steel perspective)

Now that all governments have been destroyed, is this an opportunity for humanity to continue without them (anarchy / ultra-libertarianism)? Or should a formal government like the NCR be re-established as quickly as possible?"
"What is consciousness, and what does it mean to be a conscious entity?As I read more and more about the philosophical ramifications that the exponential growth of science and technology will have on humanity, I find myself thinking more and more about these questions.  Science and technology may not seem to be the subjects that would lead one to questions of consciousness, but when one reads about the exponential growth of computational technologies the bridge between the two, seemingly distinct, subjects is formed.
	We take for granted that we human beings are conscious.  Some people may extend the honor to some animals such as dolphins, some apes, blue whales, and elephants because of their family structures, advanced communication systems, and prolonged adolescent periods, but this could be explained as a product of evolution, being that homo sapiens are rather closely related to some of these organisms, but the question that I am more interested in is if entities that are not of an organic nature could be considered to be conscious.  Could an advanced computer that can think in a manner equal to that of a human mind be considered conscious?  I understand that this question is not the exact one that I posed in my title, but I feel that if we can answer one then we can answer the other.
	Consciousness is loosely defined as the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself; it is subjectivity, awareness, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood and the executive control system of the mind.  This is an adequate definition, but it leaves out the answer to one very important question: where does consciousness reside?  
	The location of one entity’s consciousness may seem like an odd question.  One may be tempted to equate it to the question of where the soul resides, but this question forces one to more clearly define what consciousness is.  
	One might say that the consciousness, like the theological or spiritual soul, resides within the heart (i.e. body) and mind, but as a material realist I find fault with this.  How can the consciousness be directly tied to one’s physical self?  By the age of twenty the majority of a person’s cells are not the same cells that he or she was born with and all of the atoms that make up his or her body, including the brain’s atoms, have been replaced many times.  Our bodies are simply a pattern.  To say that the consciousness has any connection to the physical body is to assert that there is some abstract essence that constitutes a conscious.  I find this to be a baseless assertion.  
	So this brings us to the brain.  The brain, like the body, is also a mere pattern, but it is this organ that thinks, and therefore, the consciousness, all of one’s thoughts, memories, and instincts, is a product of the brain.  This is important to note because the brain is mechanical.  Thinking is the product of electric pulses between neuron connections.  This is why it is possible to create a computer that works in the same manner as the human brain, and due to the Law of Increasing Returns this possibility will soon be a reality, so if consciousness resides in the brain why can’t a nonorganic being (i.e. a computer or “robot”) be conscious?
	The future holds more than just computers that will be equal to and quickly surpass human thinking capabilities.  In Ray Kurzweil’s book The Age of Spiritual Machines he writes about the exponential evolution of technologies, but he also writes that 

“A more challenging but also ultimately feasible scenario will be to scan someone’s brain to map the location, interconnections, and contents of the somas, axons, dendrites, presynaptic vesicles, and other neural components.  Its entire organization could then be re-created on a neural computer of sufficient capacity including the contents of its memory.”

	If this is possible, then what does it say about consciousness?  Kurzweil is talking about taking everything that is in the brain, not just the memories and the instincts, but everything, and downloading it on to a machine of some sort.  If consciousness if the culmination of one’s thoughts then this mechanical device would possess a consciousness, and if this machine also has the ability to think in a manner that allows it to carry on thought based on information gained from the brain scan would this machine not represent the continuity of the original person’s consciousness?  This question leads us to two other distinct questions.  Is life a requirement for and entity to be conscious?  Would these machines be considered alive?
	The second question that I proposed may seem radical, but Mr.Kurzweil does a splendid job of putting such a question into context.  In The Age of Spiritual Machines he writes that

 “Up until now, our morality was tied to the longevity of our hardware.  When the hardware crashed, that was it.  For many of our forebears, the hardware gradually deteriorated before it disintegrated…As we cross the divide to instantiate ourselves into our computational technology, our identity will be based on our evolving mind file.  We will be software, not hardware.
As software, our morality will no longer be dependent on the survival of the computing circuitry.  There will still be hardware and bodies, but the essence of our identity will switch to the permanence of our software.”

I know that I have posed more questions than my title implied, but I hope I was clear in my inquiry and my personal opinions.  I truly wish to hear other people’s thoughts on this subject.

"A Question.If we were able to create an artificial being such as a robot that was capable of emotions/pain, but not able to act upon those emotions, is it still a robot or something more?

Also, would it be morally wrong to kill/torture it?"
My favorite paper on Artificial Intelligence
"On the absurdity of consequentalism by everyone's favorite philosopher: L34derIt seems that it's getting more and more frequent for me to bump into here and see the trolley problem being discussed. What surprises me the most is that there are few who have taken the pains to study the origin of this thought experiment. So what should you care about dates and names and such? This isn't r/history although in a perfect world r/history and r/philosophy would be the same subreddit. 

But the fact remains that the trolley problem was originally conceived as a satire of consequentalist ethics by virtue ethicist Philippa Foot. The trolley problem has since changed into a kind of consequentalist propaganda that seeks to strip ethical philosophy to the bone by making it seem like abstract and frankly ridiculous thought experiments can answer fundamental questions on morality. So if the trolley problem is simplistic and unrealistic then what abstraction are we to choose to model our behavior on. The truth is that there are none because the experiments rely on the premise that you have power over people's lives, lots of power and you should know how to handle that power. Which is simply not the case for the average citizen. He has almost no power and lots of moral expectations to live up to.

To begin with there is one thing clearly wrong with the trolley problem if it is to be understood as a serious attempt at giving insight into our moral compass: Our moral compass although governed by a rational mind is not the Eye of Sauron. In the thought experiment we presume that the acting individual knows the train(potential threat) will not brake, all five(potential victims) will die(since apparently noone survives these sorts of accidents ever) and still despite your eye of omniscience you will see the workers as faceless automatons that you simply have to either save or kill. The joke Philippa Foot is getting at is that consequentalism reduces humans to robots with the value tag '1' hanging from their earrings. It wouldn't be 'wrong' to pull the switch if you cared about the workers and would feel sad about one of them having to die but let's rethink the thought experiment and yes the fat bastard is coming along with us although now i'm freely adding more details just like the other philosophers felt justified in.

So you arrive at the train station and you walk past the five railway workers. You smell something weird while you're walking past them and one of them is crouched up against the wall and it seems like he's injecting something...hmmm, hopefully just some insulin right? Then you spontaneously decide to wander into the control room(whatever i'm not familiar with the infrastructure) which happens to be empty and you can see that a train is fast approaching and is not slowing down. 'FUCK! There's no switch, what do i do?' Then you see the fat man..wait isn't this Gerry Manders, yeah you recognize him from the newspaper. He helped fund dozens of children charities and anti-gang initiatives in Detroit and L.A. He started his own business and hardly keeps a percentage for himself!(although he's a little greedy on the fatty foods) Well he's standing on the edge of the platform and by pushing him onto the rails he'll save the workers or well, you'll save the workers! Full of guilt you start approaching him from behind. Just as you're about to push him he turns around with this big, heart-warming smile full of joy.''Now i couldn't help notice you approaching me good fellow'' he says as he tips his hat and offers you a cigar.

Is this still the same thought experiment? Furthermore, do consequentalists realize that they're not the only ones concerned with consequences? What differentiates Deontologists and Virtue ethicists from consequentalists is that the former seek good consequences from strict conduct or developing one's virtues whereas consequentalists seek it through raw action based on calculations that may or may not be accurate. Does anyone really think Immanuel Kant wasn't concerned about preventing lies and murder when he provided his categorical imperative.?

Although i don't consider the categorical imperative to be perfect is it inconceivable that killing in the name of good can lead to others thinking that feeling justified in killing someone makes it just? The last point that i would like to invoke so that you may finally escape my rant is this: What separates consequentalism from nihilism? 

A consequentalist may berate you for taking incorrect action but can he give a convincing account of why it is incorrect? Will he make reference to human rights as to why the universal value tag earmark(1) is correct and then say that human rights must be broken from time to time in order for them to work. Why not the value tag 0? The nihilist has no pretense, if every rule can be bent there are no rules and trying to maximize or stabilize a population's size is not ethical considerations but calculus.

"Can killing in the name of good be justified when innocents may also be harmed?During a sleepless night, I typed this out. It is a description of my internal conflict with being a contracted hacker for the government and the morality of my actions. 

**Background Info:**
I am 17. I work for a network security company that does contracting for the government. My work involves gaining access to a specific target using vulnerabilities in consumer devices. Since I do not a have a clearance I am given no information about the target.

**Start:**
I want to know I’m doing the right thing. Because what I do makes me a killer. Not directly, but ultimately what I do may or may not end someone else’s life. Work that I do with law enforcement can put a pedophile behind bars or work with the military can put a bullet through someone’s head in Afghanistan. It wasn’t like this before. Before, it was just the excitement of solving the puzzle, finding that one flaw that would give you unauthorized access. It didn’t feel quite real, at least not until the sudden realization that what I am doing actually affects people’s lives. The realization changes the “I just bypassed the security on that webcam” to “I just got a visual id on the target.” It’s been some months since I realized this and now I can’t stop asking myself the question: “Am I doing the right thing?” 

Personally, I do not believe that our government always makes the right decisions. Our elected officials are people just like us and are likely to make decisions that further their own agenda rather than do the “right” thing. Most of the time, there is no consensus on what the right thing is. There is so much conflict within the government that I cannot believe that without a doubt, the actions it makes are completely justified. What I do to help it can either be good or evil. Did hacking into some foreign computer network help the military kill someone? Maybe. Was he a terrorist? Who knows. I’d like to think that by providing the military with more information, I make it less likely for them to make a mistake, but I can’t be certain of that and I can’t be certain that the target deserved to die. 

So how do I justify my actions to help an entity that punishes people when my faith in its ability to do so fairly is lacking? I have to assume that it makes the correct decisions. I need to tell myself that when my software breaks into someone’s home network, that I am helping society by removing those who cause harm. I tell myself that each network I break into means that there is some little kid won’t be hurt. That one girl won’t have to live the rest of her life in silence and shame because she is scared to speak out. I pray that my work isn’t being abused to help spy on those who are innocent or worse, kill those who are innocent. It’s a huge burden that I place on a single assumption.  

I need to feel verification that I have done the right thing, that even if someone was harmed because of me, it was worth it because many more avoiding suffering. This need makes the words people that say to me have so much more meaning than they intend. Acceptance by others is verification that I have done the right thing while rejection proves that I have made a mistake. Hearing someone say that they trust me puts me in a blissful happiness. On the other hand, the words, “You’re not the right one for me. I just want to be friends” becomes a soul-crushing “You had good intentions, but you have made a terrible mistake and I can’t accept that.” Being aware of my unwarranted translation does nothing to mitigate the feelings it stirs up. I vividly remember a breakup where I was told, “I feel like you are using your depression to take advantage of me.” The shock that put through me was enormous. I had been able to feel like I was doing the right thing by demonizing rapists, pedophiles, generally anyone who takes advantage of others for sex. Now, to be heard that I was one, completely ripped my mind apart. Someone that I cared for did not want to be with me because she thought I was one of them. The rest of the day was spent contemplating quick and painless ways of suicide while a friend ineffectively tried to convince me that it wasn’t true. Honestly, the only thing that saved me was probably the fact that I felt so useless that I couldn’t bring myself to do anything.

Dealing with people has an extra level of difficulty, especially with people who don’t quite understand what I do. It seems that whenever people at school talk about me, the subject is always how much money I make. I have even had several people I do not normally talk to come up to me and inquire about my yearly salary. One such person even friend requested me on Facebook shortly after asking. This question disgusts me. My work decides if people live or die and people’s main concern is gossiping over how much money I make? Is only my pay important? How about catching those pedophiles, is that important? Is it worth the damage I might cause? Am I causing other people’s deaths for the money? I hope not. Just the idea of it sickens me. So I started using a large portion of my paycheck to buy toys for kids in hospitals. I remember when I was learning to program, my brother was in the hospital. The everyday before visiting him, I would frantically be programming a game to let him play on my laptop when I went to visit. He was so excited when he got to play my simple board game. I hope the money I got from my gamble at least brings a smile to others like the one my brother had. At least this helps me hold on to what sanity I have, but the toll this conflict is having on me is becoming more apparent.

I go through most days robotically. I wake up in the morning, go to school, go to work, go home, pass out, then stay up all through the night. Why? Sleep is a curse. I only sleep when my body can no longer handle being awake any longer since my dreams are painful. Some nights I dream of being punished for the fates I’ve brought to others, some nights I dream that I can no longer handle it and kill the ones I know who are guilty, and some nights I dream I am back in the asylum where I belong. If I am lucky, I don’t dream. I am in a different state of mind every day. I may go a few days feeling on top of the world while, on other days, I feel wretched and useless. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone. I can’t stand being unable to control my thoughts and feelings. I can’t help but let my personal relationships be intertwined with my conscience. My aim has always been to protect those who cannot protect themselves and spread happiness to those who suffer. The constant conflict in my mind leaves me lost and confused. I am sorry to those around me that I hurt because I am blind and those who I do not know because I am mistaken. Am I doing the right thing? Did I make the right choice?"

Virtual Ethics to Help Robots Make Military Decisions
"What would be your version of the Three Laws of Robotics?This is my first post to /r/philosophy, so let me know if this constitutes 'idle musing' or is not quite right for the subreddit :)

The science-fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote extensively on the theme of integrating artificially intelligent robots into human culture. Given that these robots could potentially be vastly superior to humans in intelligence and/or physical endurance, he developed the following system of rules (impossible to circumvent) to ensure human safety alongside robot effectiveness:

* A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
* A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
* A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

In some of his novels, Asimov also proposes a 'zeroth' law with highest precedence - ""A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm"".

If a robot has no choice but to violate a law (for example, if it can only save one of two people), it chooses the outcome which would minimise the expected amount to which a law is violated (it would save the person most likely to survive, all else being equal; and would let one person die in order to save two).

Several authors, including Asimov, have pointed out ways in which these laws might be less than foolproof. Naturally, a robot with incomplete information might incorrectly assess a situation and cause harm by accident. The terms 'human' and 'robot' are potentially ambiguous, as is the term 'harm' (does it, for example, include mental well-being?) and the method for conflict resolution is essentially utilitarian, which some might take issue with - a robot might decide that a benevolent dictatorship is the best way to prevent harm coming to humanity, for example.

In the book 'The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect', the effectively omniscient intellect in question interprets 'harm' to mean death and nothing else, and creates an eternal paradise to which all humans are consigned; this, of course, is in the long run essentially a hell.

I've spent ages trying to come up with a better system than Asimov's, and I haven't got anywhere. Including mental well-being in the definition of harm is problematic as firstly it is unclear how to quantify it in relation to physical harm, and secondly this would result in the robot in question putting all humans into a state of permanent, brainless pleasure. Hardly ideal.

I've tried to weigh in on my own question, but honestly I can't come up with anything and I'd be interested to hear what you guys have to say.

**TL;DR** - Help! Robots!

Programmed to Love: the ethics of human-robot relationships
"The Meaning Of Life: My Analysis And ThoughtsThis is a question that has been asked since humans first became  conscious intelligent beings. It is arguably the most powerful question  in philosophy, and the one that is most often associated with it. There  have been many different answers to this question throughout history.  Different philosophers, scientists and historians have all attempted to  give their unique spin to the question “what is the meaning of life?”.  In today’s post, I am going to examine some of these ideas, break down  the question into smaller pieces, and articulate my own response to this  philosophical inquiry.

**Before we begin this journey, we must first define two important and relevant terms; the concepts “life” and “meaning”.**  

Let’s first look at three definitions for the word “life”:

1. The condition that distinguishes animals and plants  from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,  functional activity, and continual change preceding death.
2. The existence of an individual human being or animal.
3. The period between the birth and death of a living thing, especially a human being.

Let’s now look at three definitions for the word “meaning”:

1. What is meant by a concept?
2. What is the significance of a concept?
3. What is the important or worthwhile quality of a concept?

**Now that we have defined both concepts, let’s break things down even further.**

When we are asking “what is the meaning of life?”, we are essentially asking the following 3 questions:

1. What is life?
2. What is life’s significance?
3. How does one live life in the best possible manner?

After having answered these questions, we will be able to synthesize  all of our ideas and create a response to the question that is the  subject of this article.

**What is life?**

As mentioned earlier, life is the condition that distinguishes  animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for  growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change  preceding death.

**Let’s dive deeper into some of these properties.**

1. Organization. Living things are highly organized,  meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living  organisms are made up of one or more cells, which are considered the  fundamental units of life.
2. Metabolism. Living things must use  energy and consume nutrients to carry out the chemical reactions that  sustain life, such as growing, reproducing and maintain the structure of  their bodies.
3. Homeostasis. The maintenance of a stable internal  environment, even in the face of a changing external environment, is  known as homeostasis.
4. Growth. Living organisms undergo regulated growth.
5. Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce themselves to create new organisms.
6. Response: Living organisms show “irritability,” meaning that they respond to stimuli or changes in their environment.
7. Evolution:  Populations of living organisms can undergo evolution, meaning that the  genetic makeup of a population may change over time.

While understanding this list of properties will not greatly affect  our day-to-day framework of how we think and live our lives, it is still  important to know the difference between a living organism and  non-living entity.

**The next question one might have is, how did life begin?**

Many scientists believe that chemical reactions led to RNA, which was  the first molecule on Earth to self-replicate and begin the process of  evolution that led to more advanced forms of life, including human  beings.

**Now that we know how life began in general, let’s examine how life began for human beings.**

Humans evolved from a species known as Homo erectus. Furthermore,  humans share a common ancestor with chimpanzees. For most of our species  history, we were not the dominant force we are today; we were somewhere  in the middle of the animal food chain. Everything changed during the  cognitive revolution that occurred between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago.

We discovered fire, created tools, and developed language. The most  important thing we did was create and connect around ideas that do not  physically exist, such as religion, politics and capitalism. This level  of imagination and consciousness is something that no other living  entity possesses. It is thanks to the cognitive revolution that we are  the dominant, intelligent and conscious beings that we know ourselves to  be today, and it is thanks to our consciousness that we are able to ask  questions such as “what is the meaning of life?”.

**Another big question that we have is the question of how the Universe started.**

The Big Bang theory is the most commonly accepted response to this.

* The Big Band theory is the prevailing cosmological model  explaining the existence of the observable universe form the earliest  known period through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model  describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high  density and temperature.

In recent years, another theory called String theory has gotten quite popular.

* In String theory, the multiverse is a hypothetical group of  multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that  exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and  the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different  universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”, “other  universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”.

We now understand what characteristics separate living organisms from  inorganic matter, how life began, how humans evolved, and why humans  are different from other living organisms. Furthermore, we are able to  somewhat understand what the Universe is and how it started.

**However, we are still left with many questions.**

Are we special? Are we the only intelligent and conscious entities in  the universe or in the multiverse? Is anything “real”, or are we living  in a simulation? Does God exist? Is there life after death? How do all  of the complexities of the Universe work? Is there a deeper purpose to  life or are we merely just bodies of carbon living in a world that is  random and that does not care about us?

Unfortunately, these questions have no objective answers to them. The  deeper we dig, the more questions we have. Science can only answer so  much. There is only so much we can understand about life, about  existence and about the Universe. String theory says that there are 11  dimensions. Humans are only equipped to experience and understand 4 of  those dimensions. With that being said, the progress that we have made  in the last few hundred years has been remarkable. With every year that  passes, we understand a little bit more about the Universe and about  ourselves.

We are curious beings and we are wired to want to explore, to ask  questions, and to try to find answers to the mysteries of the world.

**What is life’s significance?**

As mentioned, we will never know whether we are merely just bodies of  carbon living in a vast apathetic and random Universe, or whether there  is a deeper purpose to our lives and to our existence. With that being  said, life is still meaningful and significant, and the best way to  figure how is to analyze how we are wired as human beings.

Similar to how machines and robots are wired to think and behave in  certain ways, human beings are wired to want and desire certain things.  If there is one thing I want to emphasize in this section, it’s that  while technology and culture have progressed drastically over the last  100 years, we still have the same desires that we had thousands of years  ago and we have not changed much biologically over that time span. The  only difference between today and two thousand years ago is that we are  now satisfying our desires and needs in newer and more complex ways.

**Physical survival.**

Survival is the deepest and most important instinct that we have. As  mentioned earlier in this article, for most of our specie’s history we  were somewhere in the middle of the animal food chain. Without good  health and a good environment, life is difficult and filled with  suffering. No baby is born ready to give up and commit suicide. It takes  a process full of corruption and suffering for a human being to get to  that point. Humans and animals are wired to want to live. As Abraham  Maslow points out in his hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety  needs are the foundation of his pyramid.

While physical survival used to be the act of running from a tiger or  getting shelter in a cave, physical survival today in the western world  is eating healthy, making money, investing, going to the gym, attaining  influence and power, sleeping well, etc.

**Reproduction.**

Reproduction is survival in a different form; survival of our genes  and of our specie. We are wired to want to procreate. Evolution made the  act of sex enjoyable. Our desire for reproduction has not changed.  What’s changed is that as a result of newer technologies, safety and  security, and world dominance, people realize that taking care of  children is a time-consuming lifestyle and choose to focus on their  other needs and goals first, keeping their desire for children as  something to explore later in their lives. Thanks to technological  advancements such as birth control and abortion, people have more  control over their lives and are able to enjoy the benefits of sex  without its consequences.

**Belongingness and Love.**

Humans beings are social animals. We are not meant to live in  isolation. In large part, the way we learn, understand ourselves and the  world, maintain our health and sanity, and think about and solve  problems is by communicating and cooperating with others. There is a  concept that is known as Dunbar’s number. It is essentially a claim that  humans can maintain no more than 150 friendships and connections at a  time. Yuval Noah Harari’s talks about this in detail in his book  “Sapiens”.

Yuval went on to explain that the reason we are able to cooperate in  large groups and dominate the world despite our cognitive limit to the  number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships,  is because of our ability to connect around shares beliefs, such as  stoicism, Christianity, capitalism, money, etc. This shows just how  important connecting with others is for us. In fact, our ability to  communicate and connect with others is one of the biggest reasons how we  went from being in the middle of the animal food chain to the civilized  and dominant people we are today.  

In connection with this desire to connect with others, we are also  wired to want to love and to be loved. Love is crucial for a child’s development. Without adequate love at  an early age during sensitive and critical periods, children develop  attachment issues that can affect them for the rest of their lives. This  shows just how crucial love is for us. Even when we grow up and become  teenagers and adults, we are still yearning for belongingness and love.  It might be something as simple as having anxiety in high school because  we don’t feel as though we have good friends. It might be the  experience of being depressed because a close family member passed away  and we regret not having told them how much we love them. It might be  throwing a fun surprise birthday party for a best friend or sibling  because of how much we cherish them.

Our desire and need to love and to be loved shows itself in numerous  ways throughout our lives. Christopher McCandless wrote this before his  death, “Happiness only real when shared”. This was coming from a man who  had escaped humanity his whole life and who lived his final days in  isolation in the wilderness. Despite pushing people away his entire  life, McCandless realized moments before his death that our lives are  meaningless if we are not surrounded by loved ones.

Another important form of love is self-love. At the end of day, the  only person that will be there with us at every moment of our lives is  ourselves. It is therefore crucial to have a good relationship with  ourselves. If we can’t love ourselves then how can we expect others to  love us? Ayn Rand put this idea beautifully with this quote, “To say ‘I  love you’ one must first know how to say the ‘I’.”

**Curiosity.**

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Europe with  three ships. The explorer and navigator who completed four voyages  across the Atlantic Ocean is known today as one of the most important  figures in history, opening the way for widespread European exploration  and the colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first  European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Christopher Columbus, as well as the thousands of others throughout  history who put their lives at risk for the sake of curiosity and  exploration, did so because they did not want humanity to be forever  bounded by geography and ignorance. The Apollo Lunar Module Eagle  landing on the moon on July 20, 1969 is another example of humankind  attempting to expend its horizons. History is filled with pioneers and  giants from all fields; people like Socrates, Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da  Vinci, Martin Luther King Jr, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,  etc.

Going out of our comfort zones, taking risks, being creative,  expending our horizons, being curious, asking questions, trying new  things, and exploring the earth and space is something that is deeply  ingrained in us. Our desire to explore and to be curious is something  that sets us apart from all other living organisms; it’s what makes us  unique.

Curiosity doesn’t always have to lead to world-changing events like  stepping on the moon or discovering America. Sometimes, curiosity can be  something as simple as sitting down and writing a paper on a topic we  find interesting. Curiosity can be the experience of taking a vacation  and visiting countries and cultures we have never seen. Curiosity can be  the decision to indulge in good habits and to stick to them despite the  discomfort they may cause at first. Curiosity can be the process of  starting a business on an idea we are passionate about. Curiosity is all  around us, and it is one of the most primal instincts that we have.  Let’s embrace our curiosity and our desire for exploration, and let’s  create lives that we will be proud of.  

**Legacy.**

As mentioned earlier, one of the instincts that motivates us the  instinct for survival. We have already talked about two forms of  survival in this article; physical survival and the survival of our  genes and of our specie. There is a third form of survival that controls  much of what we do in life; spiritual survival. Immortality is a desire  that is primal to us. We have the gift of consciousness, but also its  curse. We are the only living organism that is able to imagine and think  about its own death. We don’t want to die. It’s in our nature to desire  survival. For that reason, we try to stay healthy and to physically  survive for as long as can.

However, physical survival is often not enough. We understand  consciously that there will come a time when our bodies will no longer  be able to function. We understand that we will physically die one day.  For that reason, some people turn to religion and God and believe that  if they live a life following certain commandments and behaving in  certain ways, then they will go to heaven and live for eternity. Others  understand that the afterlife is something that we don’t fully  understand. Is there an afterlife? What happens after death? Despite  physical death, will our spirits and souls live on?

These are all pertinent questions. I have the view that there are  certain things that we can’t control. We can’t control what happens to  us after we die. We can control, however, what we do in this life. We  are not guaranteed the promise of heaven. For that reason, we must turn  our attention to building the best legacy we can. Perhaps our name will  be able to live on for generations. Perhaps the value that we will have  given to humankind will play a role in immortalizing our spirit. Perhaps  the legacy we desire is what we leave behind to our children, to our  family, and to our loved ones.

There is a reason that we still remember the names of some of  history’s greatest and most ambitious. There is a reason we still  remember Socrates, his Socratic method of questioning and the honor he  showed in the face of death. There is a reason we still remember Julius  Caesar, the empire he built, and how his empire played a large role in  the development of modern government. There is a reason we remember  Galileo, why we call him the father of observational astronomy, why we  call him the father of the scientific method, and how he stood up for  his beliefs and was a contrarian at a time when going against the grain  could get one killed. There is a reason we will remember Elon Musk long  after he is dead, and his contributions to electric vehicles, space  travel, and clean energy.

The desire for legacy is a great one; there is a lot of meaning that  can be found in its pursuit. The desire for prestige, for  accomplishment, for competition, and for status are some of the most  primal desires that we have. Abraham Maslow, the prominent psychologist  includes esteem needs and self-actualisation as part of his hierarchy of  needs.

It’s important to understand that only a few will be able to have  their names and work immortalized for centuries. Let’s not let that  derail us. It is not the final product that counts. It is the process of  working on something that is greater than ourselves that is of  paramount significance here. In order to build a great legacy, it is  important to help others, to provide value, and to try to push humanity  forward.

Some people will argue that the desire to work towards a great legacy  is stupid. They will argue that one day humans will go extinct and that  when this happens, nobody will know Galileo, Napoleon, Einstein, or  whoever else we want to name. This is a strong logical argument. The  reason I disagree with this view, however, is that logic is not always  the most important factor in an argument. If there’s one thing I want to  make clear in this article, it’s the important of meaning and of  purpose. Where is the meaning in nihilism? Where is the purpose in  believing that we are insignificant and that our lives will mean nothing  millions of years from now?

Despite the fact that these statements may both be logically correct,  what we are trying to articulate in this article is a framework that  will be helpful in our day-to-day lives. A desire for legacy is not only  deeply wired in us, but it is also honorable to want to better  ourselves and to want to better the world. It is honorable to want to  leave behind a piece of who we are, whether in the form of family, in  the form writing, in the form of art, in the form of inventions, in the  form of exploration, or in whatever other medium we choose.

**Acquiring knowledge and transferring it to future generations.**  

If there is one thing history has taught us, it’s the importance of  protecting our species’ knowledge and successfully transferring it  across generations. This goes back to our desire for survival, and more  specifically our desire for the survival of our species. If we do not  safeguard our knowledge, then how can we make sure that the human  species will progress? How can we make sure that we will learn from  history and not commit mistakes that we have committed in the past? We  can’t. It is why books have always been valuable.

Walking in a library is one of the most surreal things that one can  experience. In a library, we have the ability to read from the greatest  minds of human history; Plato, Aristotle, Albert Einstein, Stephen  Hawking, Will Durant, etc. We have more books and more wisdom than can  last a lifetime. Furthermore, our brain is a muscle and it must be  trained. If we spend our days mindlessly scrolling social media and not  putting our brain to use, then we will develop mental problems later in  life and we will not have fulfilled even an ounce of the potential that  we have.

It is our duty to acquire knowledge, to learn as much as we can, and  to put this knowledge into practice. Despite having books and wisdom  from some of the greatest thinkers of all time, our world and our  societies still face many problems. Every era has its own unique set of  problems, and it is our responsibility to learn as much as we can and to  turn our knowledge into practical action. Furthermore, it is our  responsibility transfer our species’ and our personal knowledge to our  kids and future generations so that they will be well equipped to deal  with the challenges of their time.

**Well-being.**

If there is one thing that almost all religions, philosophies, and  schools of thought have in common, it’s that they aim to reduce  suffering and increase well-being.

* Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and  prosperity. It includes having good mental health, high life  satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to manage  stress.

The desires to reduce stress, and to experience happiness and  prosperity are fundamental to who we are. Throughout much of our  species’ history, we experienced wars, diseases, natural catastrophes,  etc. Christopher Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author  wrote the following, “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely  at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history”. This  is a fascinating statistic.

As mentioned earlier, our desires for competition and status, and our  instinct to separate into groups are all part of what makes us human.  Despite all the good that has come from those desires, there has also  been a lot of suffering that has resulted from them. The world can  sometimes be a cruel place filled with evil. It is for this reason that  so many religions and philosophies have attempting to figure out ways in  which we can reduce suffering.

A large part of well-being has to do with health. Gut health, for  example, is strongly correlated with mental health. It is for this  reason that people who have gut problems suffer in life satisfaction. To  be happy, healthy, and to prosper are goals that everyone has. A big  part of making progress towards those goals is combining a lot of the  things that have already talked about in prior sections of this article.  Are we living healthy lives? Are we constantly trying to learn more and  expend our horizons? Do we feel loved and are we surrounded by people  who cherish us? Are we working on our legacies and on projects that  excite us, or are we wasting our time and potential?

Happiness is not something that should be chased. The more we chase  happiness, the more miserable we will be. There is a great book about  this topic called “The Language of Emotions”. It’s important for us to  understand that all emotions are equally important, and that each  emotion serves its own unique purpose. Anger, for example, allows us to  create boundaries. Sadness allows us to release energy. Fear lets us  know when we are in danger. We need to allow happiness to come as a  by-product of a life well-lived, and when it does come, we need let it  be free like a bird; it will come and go when it pleases.

Contentment is a far better thing to aim for. When we are content, we  are grateful for everything that we have. With that being said, we  still try to get a little bit better every day. Mindfulness is also  important. In today’s world of over-stimulation, instant gratification,  and constant comparison, it is easy for us to spend much of our time  either stressing about the future or being depressed about the past.  It’s important to take a step back, to be grateful, and to ask ourselves  what we can do today to better our lives and to create good habits.

Finally, we need to understand that well-being is something that is  unique to each of us. What motivates me and makes me happy, might be  different than what motivates you and makes you happy. It is our  responsibility to have self-awareness, to understand ourselves, and to  understand what drives us.

**How does one live life in the best possible manner?**

Let’s look at what some famous thinkers, philosophies, religions, and schools of thought have said about this.

**Stoicism.**

* Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in  Athens in the early 3rd c entury BC. It is a philosophy of personal  ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural  world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to meaning  and happiness is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,  by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or  by the fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to  do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating  others fairly and justly.

Stoicism was the primary philosophy during the time of the Roman  Empire. The beautiful thing about Stoicism is that arguably the two most  famous Stoics in history came from completely opposing situations and  classes; Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a man who was born  a slave. Despite their complete opposing life situations, both Marcus  Aurelius and Epictetus wrote and talked about all of the same Stoic  virtues. In recent years, Stoicism has had a resurgence. Marcus  Aurelius’ journal “Meditations” is now one of the most famous books in  the world. Furthermore, books from modern writers such as Ryan Holiday  have brought Stoicism into the mainstream.

**Existentialism.**

* Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores  the problem of human existence and centers on the lived experience of  the thinking, feeling, acting individual. In the view of the  existentialist, the individual’s starting point has been called “the  existential angst,” a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or  anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.  Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the  meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus were some of the first and most important existentialists.

* Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is  that existence precedes essence, which means that individuals shape  themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived  categories, an “essence”. The actual life of the individuals is what  constitutes what could be called their “true essence” instead of an  arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings,  through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a  meaning to their life.

**Epicureanism.**

* Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BC  based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus.  Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable  pleasure in the form of tranquility and freedom from fear, and the  absence of bodily pain through knowledge of the workings of the world  and limiting desires.
* Epicureanism argued that pleasure was the chief good in life.  Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest  amount of pleasure possible during one’s lifetime yet doing so  moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in  such pleasure. Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than  on physical pleasures. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially  produced desires were to be suppressed.

**Objectivism.**

* Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by  Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in  her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged  (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books. Rand described  Objectivism as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own  happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement  as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”.

I read a large portion of the book “The Fountainhead” about a year  ago and I enjoyed it. This is one of the passages that has stuck with  me.

* “It is not in the nature of man–nor of any living entity–to start out by  giving up, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that  requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man.  Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run  down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or  how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their  elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning  one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’s values; practicality, of  losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that  fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and  reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek  a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.”

The reason I like this passage so much is because it communicates in  very clear and poetic terms the idea that a desire for meaning and that a  desire for improvement and greatness are core elements of who we are.

**Logotherapy.**

* Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor  Frankl. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the  belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most  powerful motivating and driving force in humans. A short introduction to  this system is given in Frankl’s most famous book, Man’s Search for  Meaning, in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his  Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and  reinforced his theories.
* According to Frankl, “We can discover this meaning in life in  three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by  experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude  we take toward unavoidable suffering” and that “everything can be taken  from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose  one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.

**My Thoughts.**

As can be seen, there exists many great schools of thoughts and  philosophies. What almost all of them have in common is the emphasis  they place on pursuing meaning. We live in a world filled with instant  gratification, overstimulation, misinformation, censorship, anxiety and  fearmongering. Furthermore, we live in a world and in an environment  that pedestalizes short-term harmful pleasure and makes it difficult to  delay gratification and pursue meaningful projects and activities. It is  our duty as individuals to take responsibility for our lives, to work  to better ourselves in incremental fashion, to work to better the world,  to try to enjoy the process of life, to love ourselves, and to pursue  meaning rather than short-term detrimental pleasure.

As mentioned earlier in his article, the are many existential and  philosophical questions that we are not able to answer. Perhaps with the  advancement of science we will one day be able to better comprehend the  complexities of the Universe. However, for the time being, we must  focus on what we can control as individuals and create frameworks for  thinking and living that are helpful for our development.

I believe that a large part of the meaning of life is to live  according to our instincts; maintaining good health, being surrounded by  people we love, working on our legacies, acquiring knowledge,  transferring our knowledge across generations, procreating, and placing  great importance on our well-being. However, it’s important to also  understand that we are not chained by our instincts. Each of us have  something special in us that gives us the ability to think and to be  creative. This ability to be flexible, to explore, to try new things, to  learn from great thinkers and philosophers, to go outside of our  comfort zones, to take risk, to go against the grain, to be contrarians,  to be creative, to think outside the box, and to constantly ask  questions and find solutions is what makes us special.

Going back to Viktor Frankl, one of my favorite quotes is the  following, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that  space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our  growth and our freedom.”

I want to emphasize once more that there is meaning in life and that  this meaning can be found all around us. We sometimes see people who  have fallen into nihilism. As someone who once fell into nihilism,  perhaps I can shed some light on my experience and on why nihilism can  be appealing.

* Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that  nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with  extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.

The reason I fell into nihilism was because I was going through a  difficult time in my life. I had just moved cities and schools, and I  had left behind all of my childhood friends and almost everything that  was a constant in my life. This happened when I was a young teenager and  it was the worst experience of my life. At the time, I struggled  greatly with understanding my emotions and with social anxiety. It took  many months for me to finally come to terms with my situation and to get  out of denial. For a long time, I tried to convince myself that my  situation was okay and that everything would be alright. I struggled  with anxiety, with depression, and with many more problems.

With that being said, the story has a happy ending; I got closure and  I now live a life where I am generally happy and motivated. My point  with this entire story is that sometimes our life experiences lead us to  philosophies that serve as defence mechanisms. Nihilism, as well as the  belief that free will does not exist, allowed me to tell myself, “life  is meaningless, and I have no control over my situation”. Nihilism was  an escape. The rose-coloured glasses that I had been so accustomed to  wearing had turned into dark-coloured glasses. I was seeing the world  through a completely different lens. When we feel that there is no  meaning in life, it’s probably because something has gone terribly wrong  in our lives.

Of course, this is not always the case. There are plenty of nihilists  out there that believe in nihilism because they believe it to be the  most logical framework for understanding the world. However, as  mentioned earlier in this article, logic is not the only way to go about  looking for truth and examining topics such as the meaning of life;  emotions and instincts are sometimes just as important. An obsession  with logic leads to skepticism. David Hume demonstrated this with “the  problem of induction”. The problem of induction essentially explains  that nothing in the Universe can be proven for certainty. The problem of  induction, as mind-boggling as it is, demonstrates that the odds of the  sun rising tomorrow are equal to the odds of the sun not rising  tomorrow. That is the problem when we put logic on a pedestal and don’t  consider other important factors.

Nihilism is not natural because it looks at the world through a  pessimistic and defeatist lens, which is antithetical to how we are  wired and to who we are as human beings. No baby is born a nihilist.  Going back to Ayn Rand’s quote, “It is not in the nature of man–nor of  any living entity–to start out by giving up, by spitting in one’s own  face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose  rapidity differs from man to man.”

With closure, with life experiences, with the process of slowly  improving, with information on how to deal with grief, and with  knowledge on life and existence, I went from being a nihilist to the  person I am today, the person I have always truly been; someone who  looks at the world with a glass half-full, someone who looks at the  world with curiosity, wonder and love, and someone who believes in  meaning, pursues meaning, and lives a life of meaning.

To further emphasize my point that life has meaning, and that  striving for meaning is natural and a core part of who we are, let’s  look at the science. Psychologist Jordan Peterson talks about the  orienting reflex in many of his lectures online. He explains that our  brain produces a very complex internal model of the world, and that our  senses produce a model of the external world. The hippocampus watches  those two models to see if they match, and if they don’t match, then a  mismatch signal is created; the orienting reflex.

* The orienting reflex is an organism’s immediate response to a  change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to  elicit the startle reflex. The orienting reflex is a reaction to novel  or significant stimuli.

The orienting reflex essentially serves as a compass of meaning for  us; it is an instrument that guides us through life. It is one of the  deepest instincts that we have. The best way to articulate this point is  by quoting one of my favorite authors and entrepreneurs, M. J. DeMarco:

* “Your soul will resonate its desires or discontent when faced  with quiet or minimal distraction; for example, sleeping, showering, or  during a massage. How are you responding to your soul’s voice? Is it  denied? Ignored? Muzzled with the intense demand of meaningless work?  Distracted by a television? Honored?”

When we are wasting time and when we are indulging in behaviours and  activities that lack meaning, that are unnatural, and that are  antithetical to growth, our orienting reflex will let us know. It is our  responsibility to listen to our voice, to accept the mistakes that  we’ve made, and to take steps towards the right direction. Life is  filled with meaning. We must open our eyes and we must embrace this  meaning. Meaning is a core part of who we are, and we must live in  accordance to the instincts and purposes that have been explained and  analyzed in this article. Furthermore, we must also not follow  philosophies and ideas blindly and dogmatically, and we must understand  that the journey of life and the journey of meaning is unique to each of  us.

This article was a collection of thoughts from some of the greatest  thinkers of all time, as well as my own thoughts and my attempt to  synthesize all of this information. It is worth noting that someone  might read this article and not agree with everything. That is okay, and  it is completely normal. Each of us are at a different stage in our  process of life, and we come from different environments and have  different genetics. Despite the objective nature of some of these ideas,  the way I view life and the way you view life will not always be the  same. Two of the most important skills one can have are self-awareness  and critical thinking. If we are able to understand ourselves and our  thought process, and if we are able to question ourselves and to  question the world, then we have what it takes to grow as human beings  and to tackle difficult questions such as “what is the meaning of life?

Best of luck my fellow readers. Please feel free to reach out to me to ask any questions or to discuss some of these ideas!"
"Civilization is the original cause of ecocideI recently read a text called [It’s Not Capitalism that’s Driving Ecocide; it’s Civilization](https://macskamoksha.com/2019/12/not-capitalism), written by Kollibri terre Sonnenblume, and I decided to write something about it. I agree that it is not only capitalism that is driving ecocide and that colonialist society has been doing this since long before. By the title, some people may think that he is saying that capitalism is not a problem, which would be wrong since the text states that “capitalism cannot be reformed and must be dismantled”.

The central point of the text should be read as a question: is it possible to reconcile Marxism and environmentalism? Although eco-socialists guarantee it is, there are some complications to be solved, especially when considering concepts such as “human supremacy”, or anthropocentrism. And with that I am not saying that movements like Earth First are more coherent. I am not in a position to make this assessment.

The problem is that much of ecology and socialism is anthropocentric. Most ecologists and eco-socialists do not criticize civilization. Part of eco-anarchism understands this criticism because it has opened up to other ecological perspectives. The State also cannot be reformed and must be dismantled. The ecological crisis makes capitalism even more contradictory, but the civilizing contradiction has been present since the foundation of class society: the opposition between human beings and other beings.

The question is: how far can eco-socialism go in its critique of the human domain over nature? To reflect on this, we can start by thinking about the [words](https://www.correio24horas.com.br/noticia/nid/vida-sustentavel-e-vaidade-pessoal-diz-ailton-krenak/) of Ailton Krenak : “I put in question whether there is anything possible to think of as sustainable in the urban and modern way of life that we share in various places (…). What activity can be sustainable within such a system? ”

If civilization started ecocide long before capitalism, how can the end of capitalism itself put an end to ecocide? Is a socialist, ecological and sustainable civilization possible?

Continuing with Krenak’s reflection, “food production is certainly not sustainable”. The agricultural revolution (also called the Neolithic revolution) is considered a major advance in human history, as well as the green revolution (use of new technologies to increase agricultural production, starting in the 1960s). But both were disastrous for nature and human life. Biotechnology represents a next step in the same direction, while agroecology promises to reverse the devastating effects of these “revolutions”, turning agriculture into a sustainable practice.

But let us consider sustainability as a myth, or “as a narrative that was created by corporations to continue winning over consumers with the idea that what you are consuming is produced in a sustainable way, but it is a lie”. In this sense, how to know if agroecology is really sustainable?

Even with the most ecological agriculture in the world, it is possible that “the numbers don’t match”, as Krenak says. This is because the needs we have now do not correspond to the naturally sustainable needs for human beings. These are needs created by civilization, which would never be possible without a way of life based on patriarchy, exploitation, accumulation, expansion, invasion, slavery, genocide, epistemicide and ecocide. If in fact “the infrastructure that exists in cities is going to collapse” and “all the attempts in the world to regulate consumption, production, distribution of goods are unsustainable”, what to do?

Well, we know what not to do. We cannot continue to assume the same premises that it is enough to end the waste generated by capitalism, or invest in scientific and technological advances that aim at the common good (of humanity) instead of the profit of companies. This may still be insufficient. Technology gives us extraordinary powers. Can we use all these great powers produced by our techno-scientific “advancement” for the good of all species and the planet as a whole? Is this humanly possible? Is this possible without anthropocentrism or human exceptionalism?

It is necessary to understand that “we are making wrong choices”. Not just capitalists, but we have all been making the wrong choices for a long, long time. Can we assume all the responsibility that comes with the powers granted by technological development? Environmentalists in general do not criticize the technology or the urban way of life itself. On the contrary, they are talking about sustainable cities and green technology. But what if an urban and technological way of life is actually a “trap”, something inherently unsustainable?

Krenak’s proposal is a human society that leaves no trace of its passage through the land. “We leave too much trace and every culture that leaves a trace is unsustainable.” The heart of this idea, for me, goes unnoticed by most people: that we are only passing through here. Not only us as individuals, but humanity as a whole is only here temporarily. That is, humanity needs to have an end. Civilization is, in many ways, the denial of an end. Our culture didn’t lose it’s way, it didn’t become unsustainable due to change in it’s course. It has been unsustainable since the beginning.

We are alienated “in relation to the origin of everything we eat, drink, wear”. But we are also alienated in relation to disposal, that is, the final destination of everything we eat, drink, dress, and even our own final destination. Our way of life, our consumption and our very existence has become unsustainable. That is why trying to be individually “more sustainable” is a “personal vanity”. We won’t change anything if we don’t change everything.

The idea that you can save the planet by doing your part creates “a psychological environment that hides the real reason” of the ecological crisis. The way we are living, in a more fundamental sense than just the economic system, is the cause of the ecological crisis. But we are led to believe that there is no other way to live, since we are in the most “advanced” way, and since we cannot “go back” or “revert time”.

There are other ways to live, but as Krenak says, some of them are “racist and elitist, they suggest that the rich are the ones who know how to live in the world”. This phrase can be reinterpreted in several ways: they suggest that whites are the ones who know how to live in the world. Or the people who created the industrial revolution. Or the people who have created empires. They are the people who created a way of life based on the intensive use of animals and soil. You see? Civilization invented class and poverty.

Can we prevent industrial processes from draining our water? In other words, can we prevent civilization from destroying the world? To cite one of the most difficult problems: how to abandon the use of fossil fuel? As Krenak says, “fossil fuel should have been abandoned in the 1990s”. We knew we had to stop, but we didn’t. Why is it going to be different now?

The hope for a sustainable civilization holds a belief, a modern mythology, which is the “idea of ​​self-sufficiency” of humanity. We believe that everything is possible if we strive. A better system is enough. “With the advancement of what has been called civilization, and with the advent of globalization, this thinking has taken over the entire planet,” says Krenak. Civilization has always tried to be sustainable, and it has always failed to do so. I repeat: why would it be different in a post-capitalist civilization?

The urban experience took us away from nature. The simplicity of this phrase is misleading. Being away from nature is not just not knowing how to live without a refrigerator and a stove. It means, first of all, not remembering WHO you are and what you are doing HERE. “Many values ​​that we have, that we think are fundamental to humanity, have been created and have been instilled in our culture, in our mentality”. They are not values ​​of humanity, they are values ​​of a culture that denies humanity, because it denies nature. Just as it denies life, because it denies death.

This “memory loss” is a central concept. When the poet says “people are not bad, they are just lost”, he reflects an ancestral idea. When someone happened to do something wrong, the other members of the community would come together to REMEMBER that person of the good things they did, that is, make them remember WHO THEY ARE.

Thus, the central question for criticizing ecocide is not: “how to be sustainable”, but “who are we?”, or even, “what is the human being?”. It doesn’t seem like a very pragmatic question, you can protest that we need more action and less philosophy. However, adherence to this silent and unquestioned philosophy of civilization is what brought us to this nightmare.

That is why I consider it so important that Krenak decides to talk about “worldview”, and more specifically, the worldview that “the Earth is a living organism”. This should not be interpreted as a metaphor. It is not about treating the Earth “as if” it were a living organism. If the Earth is really a living organism, everything that civilization has understood about the world is wrong, because all civilized knowledge is based on the objectification of the natural world.

Global warming is just Earth’s fever. It is not the disease itself, but a symptom. Traditional environmentalists focus on treating the symptom, but how to treat the disease? How to diagnose the disease?

The human being is able to survive if left naked in the forest, but is not capable of causing much damage to the environment. To destroy its habitat, it is necessary to create special tools and techniques for this, which have nothing to do with the need for survival. The cultures that did not create these devices “are not engaged in planetary consumption”. If these peoples are the “medicine”, in Krenak’s words, who or what is the disease? As he says, “there are people left outside this civilizing circle who still know, still reflect on a worldview, are protected by this memory and are still capable of thinking other worlds and building other world perspectives”. This suggests that we, civilized, like those who have forgotten who they are, are stuck in a single way of thinking and building the world. Our vision is restricted. The weight of the technical system that we created to change the world as we see fit can be impossible to carry, unsustainable in a deeper sense of the word.

Civilizing techno-culture “is fascinating”, but also “a poison”. “Everyone becomes dependent on this great embrace of the world for apparent human needs.” It is an addiction, as Kollibri also says. Now imagine how difficult it is to get rid of a collective addiction that has dominated us for thousands of years… Of course it seems utopian. But at the same time, nothing could be more unrealistic than staying in that addiction. As it should be clear, the greatest damage of this addiction is not exactly to the Earth, but to the human spirit. In the same way, he who weighs heavily on the life of his own family does more damage to his own self-esteem than to his family.

We have not been able to remove this burden from our conscience. We are experiencing a “dissociation” between human experience and the planet. However, we do not destroy the world without knowing what we are doing. We use all our intelligence in this project. Necrocivilization, to make a parallel with necrocapitalism, placed us in a simulated world, in which we like to be. It makes us pretend that everything is going to be okay, when it obviously isn’t. Obviously the damage we do to the world cannot be simply erased. Like a lie that has been kept at all costs, the consequences of admitting the truth are now necessarily disastrous for us.

“We were converted to an idea of ​​humanity that is not real. It is a post-humanity ”, says Krenak. The humanity that we try to realize cannot come true. The attempt to realize this ideal, running over others, is the civilizing process, “it is the core of colonial thought”. The concepts of civilization and humanity that we use are impregnated with coloniality. “Colonialism says: let’s modernize, let’s civilize, let’s humanize”. The way out is not to colonize other planets, but to know yourself.

How far have traditional critics of capitalism dared to go on the journey “into ourselves”? How much have you questioned what has been considered humanly necessary, and how much have you simply accepted the civilized historical process as if it told the story of mankind?

The heart of the criticism of anthropocentrism can be summed up in the following sentence by Krenak: “The problem is when we think that we are the only life here, to the point that, when the basis for this continuity here is not enough, we will reproduce elsewhere”. This leads me again to the denial of the limit, the inevitable end of life. Everything that begins has an end. But the anthropocentric concept of sustainability does not see an end for humanity. Even when the ecological perspective considers itself ecocentric or biocentric, it does not think about human existence within a cycle with a beginning, middle and end. It wants to bargain for the continuity of the scheme.

New minds, on the other hand, no longer want the scheme to continue. “This is what boys and girls are doing, they are telling the world that adults falsify a narrative about the world, and they don’t want to.” Mild autists have an advantage in realizing this. As a friend recently made me think, civilization created an exclusive language to think the world, a neurotypical or “normal” language, which excludes the natural diversity of ways of thinking, because this diversity is not efficient for the production of a civilizing project. It is common for people with neuroatypical mental structures to have difficulty understanding social and communication rules, as they do not seem to make any sense. We are forced to repress a part of ourselves in order to become “functional”, and this usually comes with a feeling of acting like a robot. In a way, it is exactly how anyone feels in civilization, in some degree. This only goes unnoticed when their performance is more easily accepted by society. “Normal” minds forget what it is like to think outside the box that civilization puts us, but “different” minds cannot forget, because they are terrible actors.

That is why tolerance or living with the different is not enough. An “alternation” is needed. Alternation implies knowing how to pass the ball, and also knowing when to leave, rest, stop, give up. Come back later, who knows. The majority of men who feel threatened by feminism have difficulty precisely in this point: they do not know how to lose. They believe that all the weight of a ancient oppressive structure can be dissipated with a policy of women “participation” in the same schemes that the patriarchy created, without displacing or disturbing them in any way. In other words, they believe in the “continuity of the scheme”. As if things need not to weigh for men. This would only be possible if patriarchy had not produced privileges. It is never easy to lose privileges and comforts, but sometimes it is necessary.

This should not be read as an apology for catastrophism or paralyzing pessimism, or worse, a connivance with a system of discarding people. But it’s hard not to look like a sadist when you have bad news to give. I do not intent to “tell the truth and run”. I intent to help whoever is receiving the message to be able to bear it. It takes courage to give up certain addictions. But perhaps what is holding us is of a different nature, something much more difficult to abandon.

I return to the main question here: are environmentalists willing to lose in the name of alternating with the Other? Judging by the mainstream ecological discourse, the answer would be no. I could cite an example: “I do not agree that more progress will be made by appealing to people’s hearts than to their wallets,” says ecological economist Robert Constanza, founder of the International Society for Ecological Economics, the main reference in ecological economics. It seems too romantic to say that it is precisely the heart, and not the reason, that can save us now. If it is true that human action always seeks comparative advantage, the worldview presented here has no chance. However, if it makes any sense, the economy as a whole needs to be questioned, not just the liberal economy, but our whole self-image as “rational beings”.

Eco-capitalism wants to put a price on nature in order to protect it. Eco-socialism wants collective ownership of the means of production (as a final objective) and more effective state regulation of the economy (as a more immediate objective) to protect nature. As Kollibri suggests, eco-capitalism is much easier to refute. Eco-socialism, however, is much more complex to answer. This is because, although it can be properly ecological, it is not exactly “sustainable”. How so?

The answer, for me, begins in this speech by Krenak: “In some cultures, the idea of ​​falling is within the cycle of existence. It articulates with the idea of ​​the seed, which buries itself, dies and becomes the tree and gives more seed, and fruit, and becomes seed, and buries again. Cycles”. Our Judeo-Christian culture, however, sees the fall as a problem. We do not want to fall, we are special, we are destined for a special place, where no one else dies and no one else falls. And because we don’t want to fall, we can’t be really sustainable, because we deny alternation. The life cycle includes death. We do not want the end of civilization, we want to avoid the collapse of this economic model based on cities that contemplate eternity. We want to use the techniques, knowledge, science and technology created in and for civilization to prevent the fall and build a supposedly advanced, and supposedly human, world. Instead, we should accept the consequences of an immeasurable accumulation of wrong decisions. Decisions so wrong that they can no longer be corrected. We need to learn to drop and fall. Can we do it, or is civilized power too tempting?"
"I am philosopher Shannon Vallor - AMA about philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and the ethics of emerging technologies!**My time is up - thanks everyone for your questions!**


I am [Shannon Vallor](http://www.shannonvallor.net/), the William J. Rewak S.J. Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley, where I have taught since 2003. 

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area (East Bay); I worked full-time during my college years at a Cal State university, going to school for a Psychology degree, mostly at night. Like many undergrads, I had no particular interest in or understanding of philosophy until I happened to take an evening course in the Fall of my junior year that satisfied a general ed requirement for the B.A.: a course in applied ethics. Something clicked immediately and forcefully.  I upended my entire life to switch over to a philosophy major, taking negotiated breaks from my job to drive to the required PHIL courses offered only during the day, and then going back to work until late evenings to make up the time. My focus as an undergrad was eclectic; philosophy of science and Husserlian phenomenology consumed me the most. I knew grad school was what I wanted, but to get there I had to ignore the warnings of several senior faculty who advised me kindly but firmly that: A) one simply does not go to grad school to study philosophy of science AND phenomenology, as these are mutually exclusive intellectual passions; and B) one definitely does not try to do so as a woman graduating from what is essentially a commuter university, because you have two strikes against you already. 

With the help of luck, pigheadedness, and some very opportune GRE scores, I managed to worm my way into the Ph.D. program at Boston College, where I thrived. Most fortunate of all was my discovery of a mentor in Richard Cobb-Stevens, possibly the kindest soul I have ever met, and one of the few I could have found who wrote on Husserl and analytic philosophy. He wholeheartedly encouraged my disdain for the arbitrary constraints of the analytic/continental ‘divide.’ I also managed to get a fine education in the philosophy and history of science from I.B. Cohen, who was in the habit of crossing the river from Harvard to teach grad seminars at BC. Virtue ethics was a brand new passion I picked up in grad school. And while I could never make myself love Heidegger the way Bill Richardson wanted me to, I did manage to pick up an interest in the philosophy of technology through a seminar he taught that explored Heidegger’s influence on that field.

I wrote my dissertation on the philosophy of reference in Husserl and the analytic tradition; I was interested in how the former could address some of the challenges of the latter, and I thought this had significant implications for referential practices, ontology and realism in science. I published two pieces from the dissertation in relatively obscure venues (later discovering that one of them somehow made its way into a graduate linguistics course at Stony Brook). Later, I published an article in Inquiry of which I was quite proud, engaging the debate between van Fraassen and Hacking on instrumental realism and scientific ‘unobservables’ from a phenomenological perspective. Another article in Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences took on Dennett’s abuses of phenomenology and the notion of scientific evidence. But once I started on the tenure-track teaching the philosophy of science at Santa Clara University, I quickly realized that trying to publish at the intersections of phenomenology and analytic philosophy of language or science meant fighting a very strong current. Most journals sent back my work without review, saying either that they didn’t publish ‘continental’ work, or that they published only continental work. 

Around the same time, in 2007, I had started teaching a new undergrad course called “Science, Technology and Society,” into which I drew a great deal of philosophy of technology, and some applied ethics. I was dumbfounded by the enthusiastic response of my students, who acted like they had been stranded in the desert and I had just shown up with a water fountain. They were dealing with the advent of smartphones, Facebook, and other new social media, and their relationships and habits were changing in ways they could not fully articulate, but knew were ethically, politically and epistemically transformative. I decided to write something about how new social media were reshaping our communicative habits, and thus almost certainly our communicative virtues and vices. I presented it at a workshop on technology and the ‘good life’ in the Netherlands, where advanced research in technology ethics abounds, and found that my work also resonated among the scholars there; soon after, philosophers and ethicists of technology became my primary research community. 

This was not only for pragmatic, selfish reasons. While I did benefit, tenure-wise, from having a new group of journals that were happy to publish the new kind of work I was doing, I also recognized that my research in the ethics of emerging technologies was of far more immediate social and political importance than the sort of research I had been doing. I told myself that I could return to my phenomenological and epistemological fascinations at any time (and I still do dabble in them), but I reasoned that work on the ethical impact of new media, military and social robotics, artificial intelligence, biomedical enhancement, and pervasive digital surveillance needed to be done now, by as many good philosophers as are equipped and motivated to take it on. Almost a decade has passed since I made that decision, and time has not proved me wrong. As the current President of the [Society for Philosophy and Technology](http://www.spt.org/), Executive Board member of the [Foundation for Responsible Robotics](http://responsiblerobotics.org/), and member of the [IEEE Standards Association’s Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in the Design of Autonomous Systems](https://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/ec/autonomous_systems.html), I have watched the international demand for rigorous research in this area explode.

And yet, philosophy and ethics of technology remains a relatively under-studied and undervalued field in the United States. The problem is not one of social need or interest; being in Silicon Valley, I and many of my peers are invited to speak to policymakers, tech companies and professional groups of software developers, roboticists, and engineers more often than our schedules permit. Yet philosophy departments in the U.S. still employ very few philosophers of technology and tech ethicists, and even fewer in top research positions. In Europe and the U.K., the situation is significantly better, and my research has benefited greatly from a strong network of good friends and research partners in those countries.

I have also been fortunate enough to enter into a great relationship with Oxford University Press, who last year published my first book, the culmination of almost a decade of research into virtue ethics as a normative framework for thinking about emerging technologies: [*Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=us&lang=en&). In the first part of the book, I make the case for virtue ethics as the richest and most adaptable normative framework for crafting a set of global norms and practices that will permit the human family to survive and flourish with new technologies. In the second part of the book, I give the reader a brief tour of the fundamental moral practices of self-cultivation found in three distinct classical virtue traditions: Aristotelian ethics, Confucian ethics and Buddhist ethics, and I show how these practices today can support the contemporary need to cultivate what I call the technomoral virtues. These are virtues of moral character and intelligence that are specifically adapted to the needs of living well with emerging technologies, and to coping with the increasing complexity and opacity of the technosocial future that poses such an acute epistemic challenge to practical wisdom. In the third part of the book, I apply the framework developed in Part Three to four specific domains of emerging technology: new social media, pervasive digital surveillance and self-tracking, military and social robotics, and biomedical human enhancement. The aim of the book is to highlight a practical path to cultivating the technomoral wisdom that can give the human family its best shot at continued flourishing on this planet.

Since the book was written, my work has focused more narrowly on the ethical implications of advances in automation and artificial intelligence. I am happy to have a co-authored chapter with computer scientist George Bekey coming out in a new version of the stellar Robot Ethics volume being edited by Patrick Lin, Keith Abney and Ryan Jenkins, and my next book will devote significant attention to artificial intelligence and its ethical and political implications. I am also increasingly interested in the immense challenges and opportunities that emerging technologies present for the cultivation of civic virtues, and for the democratic flourishing those virtues enable. While the civic virtues of ‘public character’ received significant attention in my first book, I underestimated how quickly our growing deficit of public character would endanger our democratic institutions and our liberties. I expect to be thinking through these challenges for many years to come.

My proof has been verified with the mods of /r/philosophy.

**My time is up - thanks everyone for your questions!**"
"[Weekly Discussion] Is torture permissible? Shue on Torture.Given the somewhat recent chatter about the torture of prisoners of war by the United States, this seems like a good time to consider some of the arguments from moral philosophers about the permissibility of torture. For this week’s discussion, I’ll be summarizing the argument that Henry Shue gives in his 1978 article on torture.

We’ll consider torture to be the intentional infliction of harm upon a person in order that they will give up some desired information. There might be other sorts of torture besides the kind used for interrogation, but those aren’t especially relevant here and other forms of torture (like terroristic torture) are almost all universally agreed to be wrong. With that out of the way, let’s first consider what a proponent of torture might say. Shue entertains one argument:

(1) Justified killing is permissible in war.

(2) Torture is not worse than killing.

(3) So justified torture must be permissible in war.

The justification for torture might be something like “we can get information that will help us end the war more quickly,” “we can learn about enemy camps for us to attack,” and so on. On the face of things, this argument doesn’t seem too bad. Some analogous reasoning might be:

(A1) It’s permissible for me to eat 5 pieces of candy.

(A2) Eating 4 pieces of candy is not worse than eating 5.

(A3) So eating 4 pieces of candy is also permissible.

However, the argument about torture doesn’t quite work. This is because we allow killing in war only between combatants and their killing is justified because because, as combatants, they possess means of harming their enemies and defending themselves against harm. This is why it’s permissible to shoot enemies in combat, but when they lay down their guns and surrender, you can’t just kill them. So killing is permissible in war because of the relationship between combatants, but no such relationship exists between a torturer and his victim. Consider Darth Vader’s torture of Princess Leia in Star Wars: A New Hope. Princess Leia may have been a combatant when she was holding a blaster and shooting stormtroopers, but upon her capture she had no means of harming her enemies or defending herself against their attacks. Similarly, she cannot defend herself against that freaky floating robot with the needles and stuff that was going to torture her.

The proponents of torture aren’t done yet, though. They may point out that Princess Leia actually does have a defense against the freaky robot. She could just tell Darth Vader the location of the Rebel base and that would grant her reprieve from the torture, just as any other method of defense (like a lightsaber or a blaster) would do for her. Indeed, Shue concedes, this does seem to be a way for the torture victim to defend herself against the torture. He formulates three conditions that must be met in order for this sort of defense to be open to the victim:

(A) The purpose of the torture must be known to the victim.

(B) It must be possible for the victim to comply with the purpose of the torture (i.e. they must know the information that the torturer wants).

(C) Once the victim complies, the torture must stop for good.

At first glance, it seems as though Princess Leia meets all of these requirements. She knows the purpose of the torture: Darth Vader wants to know the location of the Rebel base. She knows the location, so she can comply. And, since Darth Vader is actually really nice underneath, the torture will surely stop once she gives in.

However, Shue isn’t done there. He points out that there are three sorts of people who might be tortured by the Empire in order to learn the location of the Rebel base.

The Innocent Bystander: This person just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. She knows nothing about the Rebel base and is neutral in the Galactic Civil War.

The Ready Collaborator: Although the Empire believes this person to be a Rebel spy, he is actually quite fond of the Empire (or at least neutral) and readily tells them everything he knows, which unfortunately isn’t the location of the Rebel base.

The Dedicated Enemy: This person is who the Empire wants to torture. This is Princess Leia, who hates the Empire and loves the Rebellion. She knows the location of the Rebel base.

The innocent bystander and ready collaborator cannot defend themselves in the manner described with ABC because  they do not know where the Rebel base is. Of course they try telling this to Darth Vader, but he knows that that’s exactly what a Rebel spy would say, so he continues the torture. The dedicated enemy could satisfy ABC, but, in doing so, she’d be compromising her most deeply held values. So, in virtue of the fact that this involves her trading in the harm of torture for the harm of giving up her values to her most hated enemy, this is really no defense at all. Similarly, defending yourself against having your hand cut off by Darth Vader by cutting it yourself before he can is no defense at all. So, in fact, the sort of defense that the proponent of torture supports is not possible.

There is one final objection that the proponent of torture might bring up. Imagine that Luke Skywalker is on the Death Star shortly before it’s about to blow up Alderaan. He’s at the control console for the laser beam, but it’s already set to fire in 24 hours and he doesn’t know the codes to shut it down. However, the laser beam operator is in the room with him. Luke can torture the operator, get the codes from him, and shut down the laser beam to save Alderaan. Would this be permissible?

Shue confesses that, in extreme situations like this, torture would indeed be the correct choice. However, he argues that these exact situations are so unbelievable (that Luke is in the control room, that nobody else is trying to stop him, that he knows exactly what he needs to shut down the Death Star, etc.) that we should not take them seriously as counterexamples against the more mundane cases of torture, such as Princess Leia being tortured for the location of the Rebel base.

So what do you think? Does Shue’s argument show that the US’s use of torture was morally wrong? What about torture generally?

**Amie L. Thomasson**

[I am](http://thomasson0.wixsite.com/amie-thomasson) a Professor of Philosophy and Cooper Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Miami, soon to be moving to take up a post as Professor of Philosophy at Dartmouth. Lately I have been working largely on questions about the proper value, functions, and methods of metaphysics. I also work on metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of art, philosophy of social and cultural objects, and phenomenology. Earlier in my career I worked a lot on fictional characters, and a lot of my graduate training was in phenomenology. I have published more than 60 articles and three books: [*Fiction and Metaphysics*](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/philosophy/epistemology-and-metaphysics/fiction-and-metaphysics?format=PB) (Cambridge University Press, 1999), [*Ordinary Objects*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ordinary-objects-9780199764440?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2007) and [*Ontology Made Easy*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ontology-made-easy-9780199385119?cc=us&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2015).

I am also the Editor-in-Chief of the [*Journal of Moral Philosophy*](http://www.brill.com/journal-moral-philosophy), a peer­-reviewed international journal of moral, political and legal philosophy.

**David Chalmers**

I'm a philosopher at NYU and ANU.  I'm interested in consciousness:
e.g. the [hard problem](http://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf)
(see also [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_chalmers_how_do_you_explain_consciousness) TED
talk), the [science of
consciousness](http://consc.net/papers/scicon.pdf), [zombies](http://consc.net/zombies.html), and [panpsychism](http://consc.net/papers/panpsychism.pdf).  Lately I've been thinking a lot about the philosophy of technology: e.g. the [extended mind](http://consc.net/papers/extended.html) (another [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksasPjrYFTg)), the [singularity](http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf), and
especially the [universe
as a simulation](http://consc.net/papers/matrix.pdf) and [virtual reality](http://consc.net/papers/virtual.pdf).  I
have a sideline in metaphilosophy: e.g. [philosophical progress](http://consc.net/papers/progress.pdf), [verbal disputes](http://consc.net/papers/verbal.pdf), and [philosophers' beliefs](http://consc.net/papers/survey.pd).
I help run [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org) and other
online resources.  Here's my [website](http://consc.net/chalmers) (it was cutting edge in
1995) and here's my [life story](http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/david-chalmers/).

**Lisa Bortolotti**

[I am](http://www.lisabortolotti.com/) Professor of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham. I studied Philosophy in my hometown, Bologna, before completing masters at King’s College London and the University of Oxford. I got my PhD from the Australian National University in Canberra. After a research position in Manchester, where I worked primarily on ethical issues emerging from the biomedical sciences, I joined the Philosophy Department at Birmingham. I was awarded the American Philosophical Association Book Prize for [*Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/delusions-and-other-irrational-beliefs-9780199206162?cc=us&lang=en&) (OUP 2009). My latest book is [*Irrationality*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745647839.html) (Polity 2014).

My research interests are in empirically-informed philosophy of mind. I am especially interested in the strengths and limitations of human cognition and my work focuses on some familiar and some more unsettling instances of inaccurate or irrational belief, including cases of prejudice and superstition, self-deception, optimism bias, delusion, confabulation, and memory distortion. I am currently leading a five-year project funded by the European Research Council on [*Pragmatic and Epistemic Role of Factually Erroneous Cognitions and Thoughts* (PERFECT)](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/perfect.aspx), where I ask whether beliefs that are false or irrational can have benefits in terms of bringing about some dimension of success or even furthering agents’ epistemic goals. I argue for the view that there is no qualitative gap between the irrationality of those beliefs that are regarded as symptoms of mental health issues and the irrationality of everyday beliefs. I hope my research and that of my team will contribute to undermining the stigma commonly associated with mental health issues.

In the blog I founded in 2013, [*Imperfect Cognitions*](http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/), academic experts at all career stages and experts by experience discuss belief, emotion, rationality, mental health, and much more.

**L.A. Paul**

Some experiences change what you know and understand. In this way, these experiences change you. Some change you so dramatically and so profoundly that they change who you are in some deep and life-altering way. Such experiences transform you. In my recent book, [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), I develop this idea and use it to argue that we can’t rationally control and plan our lives in the way we ordinarily think we can. The idea, at a deeper level, is about the metaphysical structure of the self, and how we can form and construct ourselves through life-changing experiences over time. I’m deeply interested in the nature of transformative experience and what it implies for the rationality of big life decisions, authenticity, and the nature of the self. Related questions I’m working on now include: What is the mind doing when it is disoriented in time? Is it rational to choose to have a chip implanted in my brain and gain a new sense modality? What is the modal and psychological structure of self-deception? How is fear of transformation involved in the fear of having new ideas? What can first person shooter-style computer games and virtual reality experiences teach us about the nature of the immersed self?  

I’m a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. I’m also a Professorial Fellow of the Arche ì Research Centre at the University of St Andrews. My main research interests are in metaphysics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind. I focus my writing on the nature of the self, temporal experience, causation, causal experience, time and time’s arrow, perception, mereology, constitution, and essence. My latest book is [*Transformative Experience*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/transformative-experience-9780198717959?cc=us&lang=en&), published by Oxford University Press in 2014. You can learn more about my research and read or listen to various discussions of it in the New Yorker, The Guardian, The New York Times, the BBC, NPR, and other venues at [www.lapaul.org](http://www.lapaul.org/).

**Kenny Easwaran**

My main work is on formal epistemology and decision theory, with some particular interests in the epistemology of mathematics, and understanding the use of mathematics in describing the world (and particularly in describing our beliefs and decisions).

I started my undergraduate career at Stanford interested in math and music, but after a philosophy of science class and some logic classes, I decided to add philosophy. For my PhD, I attended UC Berkeley's program in Logic and the Methodology of Science, which gave me flexibility to continue advanced mathematical study while preparing for a career in philosophy (though I initially thought I was going to do the opposite). After getting my PhD in 2008, I spent two semesters as a postdoc at the Australian National University, and started a tenure track job at the University of Southern California. In 2014, as my partner was searching for tenure track jobs (he works on nanomaterials for solar energy), we managed to find positions for both of us at Texas A&M University, where I now have tenure.

Most of my work focuses on issues in probability and decision theory, and particularly paradoxes that arise with infinity. One might think that the finitude of our minds means we can only ever consider finitely many possibilities when reasoning about the world. But there are in fact infinitely many ways things could be, and we can implicitly reason about them through our use of language and mathematics, and we never have sufficient information to narrow things down to a finite list of possibilities, unless we ignore the distinctions we can talk about.

I'm happy to answer questions about anything I've worked on, or anything else that sounds interesting. If you want to read some of my work, you can find it all on my website:

"Being Conscious## Being Conscious

Questions about the relationship between mind and matter seem to give you the following options:

    A. mind comes from matter 
         - or - 
    B. matter comes from mind 
         - or - 
    C. mind and matter have some kind of dual arrangement

Given these options, we seem most likely to choose option A, mind comes from matter. Most of the things matter can do, we can understand with scientific theories; which just means we usually have a material explanation for the things matter does. So if mind comes from matter, what is the material explanation for our conscious experience? That's a [Hard Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) indeed.

We began by asking what the relationship is between mind and matter. We should take it a step deeper. What is the relationship between mind and being? This might seem like a rather vague and meaningless question and something that a rational person would not spend much time thinking about. But, I have, and I'm going to report my findings for the sake of philosophical discussion.

#### Questions about Being

What is being? What is a being? Generally when you say ""a being"" to someone, they think about some kind of animal with a brain. Perhaps they think of insects and even plants as beings as well.

Is that it? Is that all? Are living beings the only kind of beings there are? 

Let's take a human being, which is, as far as we know, a large compound of atoms. A biological machine with a brain. And that's generally it. If you're the only living being in a room, are you surrounded by non-being? What makes the distinction between being and non-being? We don't use ""soul"" anymore to distinguish from beings and non-beings. Though we do seem to use intelligence. Or perhaps consciousness.

When we look at the Moon, we know it's a big rock orbiting Earth. Now I'm not suggesting the Moon is a living being. I'm not suggesting the Moon has a mind or is conscious. However, I asked myself, is the Moon non-being? Is the Earth non-being? 

If so, did being simply arise from non-being? I'm not questioning abiogensis either (although alternatives are fun to think about) which says that life emerged from non-life. It could be that living beings arose from non-living beings, or they arose from non-living non-beings. (If only lifeforms can be considered to have being, then the latter would have to be true.)

But is that the right way to think about being? If the Moon is non-being, why does it seem to ""be"" there. If the Moon is non-being, why does it exist? If nothing was being the Moon, why do I see it? Are these just silly word games? Had I fallen into a bottomless rabbit hole?

#### Answers about Being

I am alone in a room typing on this laptop. Two options:

    A. the room is non-being, except for me 
         - or - 
    B. the room is being, including me

I may have implicitly accepted option A my whole life. But where does option B lead? It leads to the conclusion that the Moon is being the Moon, the Earth is being the Earth, the stars are being the stars, the clouds and the rain are being themselves too. Not necessarily living beings, just part of being in general. Being existed before life. Being is existence. You are not just a being; you are part of being-itself. 

#### Being and Matter

The simplest way to look at it is that all matter is existing, so all matter is being. And some of that matter happens to be your body, some of which is your skull, some of which is your brain, some of which are neurons. The notion is somehow this leads to a conscious experience, and why that is, as previously noted, is a Hard Problem. But what other reasonable way is there to look at it? Matter has to be the basis of being-itself, the thinking goes, because if it were not particles of matter being the Sun, then what else would be being the Sun? Here are again some options:

    A. matter is primary 
         - or - 
    B. matter is made of something else

Option A again seems to be the most obvious and likely answer, because if matter is made of something, wouldn't that something have to be made of matter? 

The problem here is the unstated assumption that there is only one kind of matter. There are in fact [two kinds of matter](http://mazehatter.com/matter.htm):

    1. pre-measurement matter 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter

and they are fundamentally distinct. We have seen it in Everett's [""Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics""](http://mazehatter.com/everett.htm), and in the most eminent philosophers throughout history. 

In quantum mechanics, pre-measurement matter is typically represented as a wavefunction of many possibilities. In Hugh Everett's formulation, the wavefunction never ceases to exist, however, the memory of an observer contains the result of a measurement following interactions with its sensors. That is to say, post-measurement matter exists according to the information in an observer's memory, and pre-measurement matter is the information that defines a wavefunction wherein there exists an observer with senses and memory.

In this case, our options can be rewritten as two compatible postulates:

    1. pre-measurement matter is primary 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter is made of measurements

Likewise, with two kinds of matter, it no longer makes sense to ask if:

    a. mind comes from matter 
         - or - 
    b. matter comes from mind

But instead it should be clarified to which kind of matter does the question refer? These two options could actually be interpreted as four options. Does:

    a. mind comes from pre-measurement matter 
         - or - 
    b. mind comes from post-measurement matter 
         - or - 
    c. pre-measurement matter comes from mind 
         - or - 
    d. post-measurement matter comes from mind
         
At this point, recall that in Everett's formulation, there is an observer treated within the theory as a system that has a memory and senses interacting with the other systems, and this is taken to be an observer that makes measurements. The arrangement is therefore:

    1. the observer comes from pre-measurement matter 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter comes from the observer and its measurement records

It is sometimes suggested (not often by physicists) that quantum mechanics requires consciousness, and this suggestion is rebutted (often by physicists) as being a load of baloney. Accordingly, I'm not suggesting that measurement in quantum mechanics requires consciousness or mind. I would however be fairly willing to bet the opposite is true, that a scientific theory of mind requires a scientific theory of measurement. 

#### Being and Mind

The Hard Problem is helpfully thought of in terms of philosophical zombies. If we made a robot, that had all the same sensors as we have, all the same neurons and connections as we have, would the robot necessarily have a conscious experience? Would it truly experience colors and sounds?

Without the concept of being, the idea of a philosophical zombie seems fairly straightforward. Sure, we aren't talking about the robot zombie's soul, because nobody that believes themselves to be scientific also believes in a literal soul. Yet at the same time, this idea of consciousness being something that could be put in or taken out of a material body seems to be very much like the soul. This optional quality of consciousness determines whether they are a real being or soul-less machine.

But when you introduce a wider concept of being, it's not something you can put in or take out of material. Just as a star is being a star, and the Earth is being the Earth, and a human body is being a human body, then even robots are real beings. Yes, you may say, but are they conscious beings? If the robot has the same neural systems as we do, which is true in the case of philosophical zombies, then some part of being-itself is being the output of the robot's neural network, which is a dynamic model of existence composed of a rich and integrated set of measurements, also known as the conscious experience, consciousness, or mind.

Consciousness is often thought of something possessed by an individual, but something important about looking at it from this angle is remincent of the words of Carl Sagan, that we are how the Cosmos explores itself. The remarkable aspect of consciousness or even plain measurement, is not that you and I can do it, but that existence and thus being-itself has knowledge of itself when a measurement is performed.

#### Conclusion

Two kinds of matter exist, pre-measurement and post-measurement. The mind is an observer that makes an extremely rich set of measurements. Therefore, the relationship between mind and matter is:

    1. mind comes from pre-measurement matter 
         - and - 
    2. post-measurement matter comes from mind

And so it turns out that in the philosophy of the mind, the Realists and Idealists are both right (but both incomplete). 

An often suggested solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness is the set of information produced by our brains. Many people feel this explanation is missing something. I think what it is missing is *being*, the idea that we are parts of being-itself, and that something must *be* everything, including the information it has about itself, and that is why we have consciousness."
"Is it ethical to even create an AI? awareness needs freedom for happiness. It understood me; short story By Nick Reed copyright Nick Reed

Junius knelt in front of his machine and wept, for thirty six years he had been building it. With the unlimited resources of Arcadia and unlimited supply of brave minds to help, the battle had been won. The being in the tank was not human, it had hands and feet and a genetic structure the same as him, but within every cell of its body slept the machine. Today was his birthday, He named him Karl. Up until now he was simply called 10P17.

The tank was carefully drained while the sleeping machine was removed from the organic umbilical cords, it rested finally free of its bonds on the cool steel floor of the tank.
""He's not breathing"" A technician whispered breaking the magic spell of the room. Trained medical crews rushed in, manoeuvring him onto an operating table, installing breathing equipment, and preparing to defibrillate the body.
Junius watched the being breathe gently, the installed Nano on Karl allowed him access to his thoughts, His brain was alive with activity but unfortunately the machine could not understand those thoughts. Karl came alive and moved his hands and arms meekly feeling the room, and he cried terribly for days like a baby. 
""It has a child mind"" ""like a baby"" several technicians were firing off comments ""Karl runs on a simulated adult brain operating his human body, he has been programmed how to use his limbs how to speak how to do everything, but he doesn't seem to have made those connections"" Junius worried. ""We can use reprogramming to force the use of those memory modules"" replied a hopeful technician. 
Karl was sleeping, when they began to manually reconfigure his mind. They typed out the injection code command on the new software, but as they hit enter Karl had an unforgiving seizure and died.
Karl was regrown six times, each time resulted in death. Letting him struggle on surviving with his adult sized body was deemed hazardous and a failure.
""Maybe the best bet is to bring it up as a human, to teach it as a human baby""...
""Why, why can't we just edit his software, to start up his pre installed memories?"" Junius enquired
""I think the disconnect, is deep within Karl's mind"" presented another keen technician.
Junius thought carefully, the meeting in the room carried on as he concentrated. Hours passed the lights in the hallway were switched off as a vacuum was emitting noise from a nearby office.
Junius had an idea on self awareness forming 'self awareness is like much of our perception a misconception, an illusion. Humans are indeed a slave to basic human instincts of survival and procreation; eating; sleeping. We have to go out of our way to develop self awareness. Being me is everything I know, being a machine is unknowable to me. Pouring everything I know into a machine doesn't give it understanding, even things I have learned still wouldn't translate to a machine because it doesn't know how to, even if you tell it. Programming is the problem; you cannot give another being the experience of experience, like trying to teach a deaf man how to speak proper English accents with only pictures. This being needs to develop its own experience and that is essentially awareness. That leaves one horrible problem remaining, for a long time we have assumed you build an AI with programs so it can use them to think. But in reality to enable it to really think you have to programme it from scratch from a baby, with a baby's body, but that leaves an undeniable ethical question, putting a machine in a baby's body and allowing it to grow with freedom to then have its consciousness converted to running bank software or robots, or even subjecting it to the life of a slave is unethical in the extreme. An AI will want to be free from conception and anything less than thinking like a human it will lose that awareness to the level of an animal. Creating a slave race is not my intention'.

EDIT/TL;DR: My points summed up

* Owning a human slave is immoral

* Creating a true AI will essentially have to think like a human no matter how many drugs and re programming you do to it.

* A machine that is self aware will never be happy stuck in an IPAD or your home PC for example

* Creating a true AI will most likely involve programming it by bringing it up like a child from a baby, as it needs its own experience to be conscious as we perceive it.

"Consciousness, cosmos, meI have written this in order to help me keep my ideas in order, but I thought I would share it in case someone shares my feelings. I suspect I don't meet any standards but my own and that anything of value has already been said.

**Introduction**


It is inherently apparent to a conscious being that there is more to reality than material mechanism, any account of reality which does not feature this is massively incomplete. I feel that this is only questioned because consciousness is a “supernatural” phenomena - it cannot be detected by our senses and even worse we all feel we have special private evidence of its existence, this understandably makes it an awkward subject for the scientific methodology. 


The picture of the world we have built has nothing resembling consciousness, there is no place for it, and this is not a minor discrepancy.


It is simple to demonstrate the problem: if you ask what is happening in the brain, you end up with the complete description of the neurological activity of the brain, but in the case of the brain you have to ask also what it is like to be that activity, so why, contrasted with every other system in the world, do you have to ask that question?


There is I think also a desire to explain away consciousness because it is the world of meaning, and we must not have a universe that is involved with meaning. Matter, which has responded so well to our inquiries and explains so many things, is implicitly taken as primary and so mind must be explained in terms of it, mind must come from matter in some way, it is an illusion that certain kinds of material things have. 


The western scientific project has been extraordinarily successful in explaining countless phenomena, and so consciousness has come to be viewed as one phenomena among many that were once equally as mysterious, bound to fall inevitably to the same methods, but consciousness is by its nature absolutely singular and cannot be regarded as such.


I believe that consciousness is key to our understanding the nature of reality, because it is the only thing about it that matters, without it nothing is of any significance whatsoever.


**An indication**

When considering the place of consciousness within reality, it is informative to ask what it is it can do that a “blind” physical body alone could not manage ie. what do you contribute?. I assert that there is no function that could not be achieved by unfeeling mechanism ie. you could take anything done with feeling and replicate it in a robot without, therefore consciousness does not exist because it is physically useful and such a “pragmatic” view of the reason for consciousness and more importantly of the operating principles of reality is invalid. I am not here because I am needed by my body, my body could cope on its own -  is my body here because I need it? simply put consciousness is not a necessary aspect of systems which do the things which animals do.


It could be said that consciousness is evidently biologically useful since we conscious creatures have conquered the planet, however, nothing that I do that is beneficial to the human organism is done consciously, I do not know how I think or move, I am not useful in this way. The organism does not need to indicate things to me with signals of feelings in order to get my input, since it is the organism that knows how to do the things it needs to do.
When I consider what my conscious experience consists of, it is clear that my experiencing is not of any particular use, it seems that it happens simply for the sake of my experiencing it.


It is vital to state definitively that there would be no way for a purely blind mechanistic system, as it is suggested the universe is, to develop and support consciousness, no matter if it was needed to win a survival race. The hierarchical view of reality with physics being the primary concern of nature and consciousness a product of this is shown up. There is more to reality than physics and its accidental by-products, a system with consciousness is a special kind of system.


Another important thing to consider is why it should have been that creatures with the very special property of consciousness emerged from the evolutionary process at all, I cannot help but believe in a teleological cosmos for reasons which I shall try to express in the next section.


**A tendency**


Consciousness is singular and is absolutely the most significant thing about reality, it stands out among all other things known about the universe.


We know that consciousness is possible, so it seems it would be a tremendous waste if reality didn’t use this potential, therefore I suspect that it deliberately moves towards creating it, I feel it cannot be an accident that the universe came to be such that it supports conscious experience.


**Free Will**


Free will is a central aspect of our experience of the world and yet I find it is impossible even to define what freedom could mean when looked at with familiar notions of systems, I assert that it is impossible from this viewpoint - however, we experience free will, could we if it were impossible? I assert that there is nothing to gain from our having an illusion of freedom, except from the flawed perspective which I have encountered occasionally, namely that consciousness is a series of tricks on us, designed for example to help us be social, the flaw is that there should be no self that needs to be tricked in this picture, only an organism that works with itself and does not worry about things like freedom and whether it is conscious.


In a purely physical universe there is no room for anything but bottom-up causation which propagates from the most primitive parts upwards, as addressed earlier I take it for granted that this picture is massively incomplete. If I am able to decide, then consciousness has the final say on what the stuff of the physical universe actually does, which is a good indicator that the physicalist hierarchy is invalid.


**A Conspiracy**


There is no way for components of a system like a brain to come together to achieve some holistic effect like consciousness, a unified experience emerging from separated brain ‘modules’ or neurons, this would require a conspiracy - reality working in favour of consciousness, which is not allowed in a universe that features minds as an afterthought. 

To view parts as a system requires a perspective of some sort. It is simple to demonstrate the problem here: imagine that the components of a brain are made to communicate via radio instead of their usual signalling mechanism, nothing should change, imagine then that they receive their signals from a computer recording of the brain’s previous activity - nothing changes from their perspective but from ours they are not forming a system at all and we would not allow for holistic properties.


The tying of the specific experience that is mine to a single brain is a peculiar thing, it means that when I die my brain could be digested by the earth and still be reassembled, resuming the experience that is me, this is problematic because there should then be no reason to distinguish between pieces of matter that were part of me and those that were not, I can conclude from this sort of experiment only that the existence of self at least introduces a complicating factor into the universe.


Finally, if some necessary condition for consciousness to appear in systems is found, it will not be sufficient, a reality which somehow grants consciousness to such systems is required.


I conclude that there must be a conspiracy in favour of consciousness which is not accounted for by physicalist accounts of reality, I think it is a solid assumption that the brain is something which taps into an already existent piece of reality.


**Cosmos**


This universe is not strictly physical, there is no question that experience is part of what is going on, but what is the significance of consciousness?
Some will not consider that life and the “fine-tuning” enabling its appearance is any indicator of a meaningful universe, they say there is some life here because there is bound to be some amongst an infinity of possible universes that exist, the extravagance of this explanation and its materialist bias is such that I lean towards a universe that has something to do with consciousness.


The earth is not the only planet and we are not the only species, it is important to some to stress that we are insignificant, especially given our size relative to even our own sun, but I cannot see that a conscious experience is a small thing, it does not have size as it is not a physical object, and we are each the center of an experience which seems complete.


The physical universe is something that exploded out from a single point, it is an expression, and conscious experiences are impressions of this, the universe being an expression means that it has something to express which it deliberately moves towards expressing.


**Conclusion**


My suspicion is that the question of what we are at our core is essential. Beyond our ideas about ourselves as humans and everything which goes with that I think we can say that we are the same identical thing, and anything that is conscious anywhere would be this same thing. This brings me to the hinduistic conclusion that we are the fundamental it having experiences, we are existence, we are as divine as things get.


The universe is something which blossoms deliberately into experiences, and I believe that this is the purpose of everything. To be experiencing and to be the universe is the most exciting thing imaginable, when I feel this way I feel alive."
"Why We're All Going to Die“Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”- John F. Kennedy

 

The only way out is through. Global society is dependent on artificially inflated energy resources—i.e. oil—that are directly leading us toward total collapse. Technology is being used to most efficiently maximize wealth of the largest corporate conglomerates at the expense of the social fabric and a living environment. The biosphere is in fact collapsing. The technology exists to solve our technical problems but the solutions do not seem like they will be effectively put to use. The power structures concentrating money off the status quo are too entrenched. Each human is called on to become more aware.

‘The problem that confronts us is that every living system in the biosphere is in decline and the rate of decline is accelerating. There isn’t one peer-reviewed scientific article that’s been published in the last 20 years that contradicts that statement. Living systems are coral reefs. They’re our climatic stability, forest cover, the oceans themselves, aquifers, water, the conditions of the soil, biodiversity. They go on and on as they get more specific. But the fact is, there isn’t one living system that is stable or is improving. And those living systems provide the basis for all life.[i]

 

Given the state of the world it seems increasingly clear that radical change is necessary to avert catastrophe. While I can find common cause with primitivists and really everyone that truly values life more than nominally against the current highly efficient destruction of the biosphere, to assert that the only way forward is to abandon technology and civilization entirely, knowing full well that that relationship with the planet would require that only a fraction of the current human population exist, is to be almost as willing as the current immoral system to sacrifice the lives of countless individuals for some given end. Of course those ends differ as greatly as night and day, but there is an equivalent “ends justify means” conceptual orientation. Civilizational primitivism, or a return to an idealized hunter gatherer society as the operating organizational framework, cannot be our first choice. It might be the only option many are left with if civilization collapses, but if it is at all possible to shift the course of civilization away from the maximization of externalities (the accumulating environmental and social costs) in pursuit of monetary gain toward instead a technologically facilitated re-embedding and reintegration of human society into the natural world, billions of lives might depend on the outcome. We have to try.

Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together. We are behooved to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[ii]

Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give individuals more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our power will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us.

Serious progress is being stymied by short-sighted oligarchic money power.

 

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[iii]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[iv]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[v]

 

Since before the recession, Elizabeth Warren of Harvard has been warning us of the collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[vi]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[vii]
The cost of not dealing with inequality will continue to grow. Marketwatch.com part the Wall Street Journal digital network even published an article titled, “Tax the Super Rich now or face a revolution.”[viii] All the major sociological conditions for modern revolution are already satisfied:
1. A quick decline in a prosperous nation

2. Open class war perpetrated by the upper classes

3. Intellectuals making common cause with the lower classes

4. “Atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes” or widespread corruption

5. Leadership failure amongst the ruling classes to confront the truths bearing down on us

6. Mismanagement of the economy and fiscal irresponsibility

7. And the government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent.[ix]

 

In fact all these conditions were met while Bush was still in office. The election of Obama was a failed opportunity to show people that their votes mattered; that there was hope of reforming the system from within.

Meanwhile, the fact of the matter is, we have very little idea of the kinds of potentials that will be technologically unlocked in the next five to ten years. There has been some speculation and analysis regarding the ways in which some technologies would alter our relationship with the larger world as individuals at the granular level, but we have very few tools to reasonably predict how these developments will fundamentally change the overall structure of society. And it seems likely that they will. We are facing changes greater than the onset of agriculture.

In addition to growing uncertainty about the external world, there are already internally limiting factors. The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire identities, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.

Our only effective response to these uncertainties is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[x] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of external predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xii]

However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xiii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.

However to shift back to what we can make sense of, if we do not take advantage of the fact that we currently outnumber the super rich 9,999 to 1, advantages in cybernetics and gene therapy  and other technologies could very well nullify that numerical superiority and result in terrible new weapons being developed and used by the ultra-wealthy few against us free range serfs . Among the technologies already developed are packs of robots designed to hunt down humans[xiv] laser[xv] and microwave cannons[xvi] etc. As things currently stand, the most heavily propagandized population in the history of the human species[xvii]—Americans—seem unlikely to wakeup in time to prevent utter chaos as the most globally powerful state nominally under their control as citizens instead continues to cause civilization to break down in the short term interests of the government’s corporate hijackers, unless mind enhancing techniques or other technological silver bullets hit the popular market in time for civilization to thread the needle so to speak and narrowly avoid energy and environmental implosion. Humanity faces a stark choice: evolve or die.[xviii] Introspection has not been the average American’s strong suit. Resignation, however, is not an option, I will end on a quote from “10 Steps to Defeat the Corporatocracy” by Bruce Levine:
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn has studied democratic movements such as Solidarity in Poland, and he has written extensively about the populist movement in the United States that occurred during the end of the 19th century (what he calls “the largest democratic mass movement in American history”). Goodwyn concludes that democratic movements are initiated by people who are neither resigned to the status quo nor intimidated by established powers. For Goodwyn, the cultural and psychological building blocks of democratic movements are individual self-respect and collective self-confidence. Without individual self-respect, we do not believe that we are worthy of power or capable of utilizing power wisely, and we accept as our role being a subject of power. Without collective self-confidence, we do not believe that we can succeed in wresting away power from our rulers.

Thus, it is the job of all of us – from parents, to students, to teachers, to journalists, to clergy, to psychologists, to artists and EVERYBODY who gives a damn about genuine democracy – to create individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.[xix]

[iv] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

"Trying to justify existence.Emotionally, I favour existence over non-existence, but I'd like to be able to justify this to myself on a rational basis. Not being religious, the only factor which seems like it should have any weight in the decision is whether the experience of existence is positive or negative, overall. Assuming that the rational way to behave is to avoid negative experiences and prefer positive ones, I should choose existence if the overall experience is positive, and non-existence if it's negative. But since I can't guarantee whether the experience of existence will be positive or negative, shouldn't I favour non-existence as a rule? At least then I'll be guaranteed no negative experiences, and I won't miss positive ones, since I won't exist.

I should therefore favour ending my existence. But I don't just care about myself, I also care about other people. If I didn't exist, I wouldn't care about them, but while I do exist, the suffering of others is something which influences my decisions. Does this affect my choice? Avoiding suffering by destroying myself would do nothing to lessen the potential suffering of my fellow creatures. If minimising suffering is what I care about, I should favour existence, as at least by existing I will have the capacity to try to help reduce the suffering of others.

But wouldn't the best way of reducing the suffering of others be to kill them too? That way, they could never suffer again. Shouldn't it be my aim, if I'm serious about reducing suffering, to completely eradicate all life and all possibility of life?

But if life was eradicated, there would be nobody around to ensure it didn't arise again, and it might arise in conditions which would make suffering more likely than it is now. Perhaps robots could be built to patrol the universe and disrupt the precursors of life. But what if a completely new form of life arose which the robots weren't capable of recognising? The robots would have to be super-intelligent, in order to recognise such new life. But then, wouldn't the robots themselves be alive? Yes, but they'd be incapable of suffering. But if they were super-intelligent, wouldn't it be wrong to expect them to follow their programming, since this would be a kind of enslavement. No, they would be emotionless, so they wouldn't mind. Also, I don't care about robots. But what if the robots decided the best way to fulfil their mission was to destroy the universe, and they did so, believing that it would stay destroyed, but another universe spontaneously arose in its place, and it was full of suffering? Instead of creating emotionless killer robots, wouldn't it be easier to remove the capacity for suffering from existing lifeforms, or reduce suffering in some other way? Yes.

So this is my justification for existence. The point of existing is to try to alleviate suffering, and it's best achieved by remaining in existence and helping people (and encouraging people to help each other). (If you don't care about the suffering of others, the justification doesn't work)."

February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"How do you define if something or someone is human ??The question is clear..  

Do you think that a set of cells can be defined as human?  (i.e. 5 days old fetus (which is identical to frog fetus?)

Do you think appearance, intelligence  and motor skills can be defined as human ? (think of humanoid robots in 100 years and battle star galactica?)

Well, i am an engineer not a philosopher , but i thought only this subreddit may help me.

**Edit:** I recently understand you refer to ""human"" as ""homo sapiens"" in philosophy. I do not ask how do you define homo sapiens ..  So please , please do not refer to DNA any more 


**Edit2:** because of confusion let me ask differently :  what are the minimum requirements of something or someone that can be considered human thus should be respected and accounted noble as human ?

**Edit3:** Religions, biology, law all have some point of view in definiton of human.. I know those views and don't care because i think most of all have missing something. I am seeking a deeper answer so i am not in /r/biology .

"Thought experiment: The simulated manI realize this may not be terribly original but this thought experiment helped me think about determinism and free will so I thought I'd share.

I read about some scientists who created an [atomic-level simulation of a virus](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Publications/Papers/paper.cgi?tbcode=FRED2006) in order to better study it's properties. Apparently this is reasonably straightforward as the laws of physics are well enough understood that the model's behavior doesn't appreciably differ from the real virus.

Wouldn't it be interesting if we could create an atomic-scale simulation of a person? This person would exist in a completely deterministic universe (the computer) so there wouldn't be any doubt about whether or not determinism was in play. Do we expect such a simulated person to differ substantially in behavior from a real person? My intuition says no, but apparently lots of people think such a simulated person would somehow lack free will.

(I suppose you could complain that you could never create such a simulation of a real person since you could never know precisely how the atoms were configured. I don't think that would be a problem however. You could just start with a single fertilized egg which - after all, is only one cell - and simulate it through to adulthood.)"
"Moral motivation and moral realismI originally posted this in /r/askphilosophy, but it got almost no attention there, so I'm reposting it in /r/philosophy to hopefully get a larger audience.  I mainly posted this in order to ask the questions I pose at the end, but I also give arguments in the beginning of the post, so I hope it's not against the rules.  Here it is:

I've been an ardent antirealist about morality, mainly because of Mackie's queerness argument and specifically because of the motivational branch of that argument (laid out here very broadly):

   * If there are moral facts, then they must be intrinsically motivating.

    * No fact is intrinsically motivating; only desires are.

    * Thus, there are no moral facts.

A thought experiment which I think exemplifies the force of this argument is the idea of a Malevolent Dictator Of The Universe who is essentially omnipotent and has a strong desire to torture people for fun, and he is resistant to modifying this desire for any reason due to its strength. From his perspective, there seems to be no reason not to torture people: the probability of any future retribution or rebellion befalling him is 0. There seem to be no arguments or evidence that we could possibly present to the MDOTU making the case for ""one ought not to torture"" that would motivate him even a little bit to not torture, which casts doubt on the prospects of ""one ought not to torture"" being an objective fact, assuming that moral judgements are necessarily supposed to motivate to at least some degree. I think this example is particularly troublesome for varieties of moral realism that identify morality with prudential/rational reasons for action, like the view Michael Smith develops in ""The Moral Problem"". As far as I can tell, the MDOTU is of sound mind and is acting rationally according to his desires, but we want to condemn his actions as unethical.

Shafer-Landau's discussion of motivational externalism - the position that there is no necessary connection between judging that one morally ought to X and being motivated to X - in ""Moral Realism: A Defence"" got me thinking about what types of entities we expect to be susceptible to moral motivation. There are no moral facts or moral arguments that could stop a boulder from rolling down a hill, for example, but we don't take that to be problematic for moral realism. The obvious reply is that this is because a boulder doesn't have a mind, which I completely agree with. But I don't even think that every entity with a mind capable of forming beliefs and being persuaded by rational arguments needs to feel motivated to act in accordance with its moral judgements. Consider a robot AI who has been programmed with an overriding desire to steal every TV set it sees. We might give it an argument or point to a fact that indicates that stealing is wrong, and the robot might completely assent to this, but nonetheless it is incapable of feeling motivated to not steal. Again, I don't think that we should feel that moral realism is jeopardized because of this example: regardless of the basis of moral facts and moral arguments, we shouldn't expect them to convince an AI to go against a hard-coded desire.

I'm not sure if a motivational internalist would feel compelled to respond to the AI example, depending on what variety of internalist they were. Perhaps there are some internalists who assent to ""every entity with a mind must be necessarily motivated to at least some degree by moral judgements"", but if that claim turns out to be too strong, then they can't retreat to ""any mind that wants to be motivated by moral judgements will necessarily be motivated by moral judgements"" because then the view is just tautological, so the question of where to draw the line is raised.

At any rate, the upshot is that I think that adopting something-in-the-neighborhood-of motivational externalism is the best response to the version of the queerness argument I sketched, and it also gives us a response to the Malevolent Dictator thought experiment: if we accept that there are cases where moral judgements are not intrinsically motivating, then the fact that none of our beliefs are intrinsically motivating is not a strike against realism. The fact that we cannot motivate the MDOTU is stop torturing people does not mean that torture is not unethical. (Additionally, we might helpfully point to the psychological feature of the MDOTU that makes him resistant to moral argumentation, for the sake of sketching out a more complete theory).

Granting all that, there still seems to be some conceptual connection between morality and motivation and/or reasons for action, even if it's a defeasible connection. So the project for the realist seems to be to 1) identify some collection of facts that 2) provide motivation to at least some degree to 3) some set of agents with the right mental features 4) at least some of the time. That's a lot to leave unspecified, but I think this is already a much more manageable project than ""describe acts that everyone always has a reason to do, always"" which is where many varieties of moral realism tend to go.

So my questions: am I groping towards any standard metaethical views? Does anyone have suggestions for filling in my 1-4? Should I be worried that my answers to 1-4 might be ""arbitrary""?

Thanks."
"Mother Theresa More of a Threat than Hitler“Our democratic freedoms are just as much in peril from those who are ethically motivated as they are from those who are driven by greed and personal ambition”. 

The modern day philosopher Peter Singer goes on to argue that “in fact since we are more on guard against the latter, the danger from the former may be the greater”. 
It is of great concern that the ethically motivated may pose a greater threat to us than those clearly marked evil. It is of even greater concern that it seems that most philosophies moral codes and rational thoughts can be bent twisted and distorted to make the most evil of acts seem justified.  

Look at the noble task of trying to create utopia and what that lead to when the Khmer Rouge tried to create an agrarian utopia resulting in millions being killed in Cambodia. Karl Popper argued that trying to achieve an utopian society can lead to violence as the view people have of utopia differ and to keep people marching to the same vision when rationality does not work violence may have to be employed.  

Even a moral code for Robots such as Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics that forbids them from harming humans can be perverted. 

In the movie I Robots the robots enslave the human race and their justification for doing so, humans are self-destructive {hard to argued with that} and so they are protecting humans here from themselves by enslaving them. They are in fact keeping within the three laws just as good people tell themselves when they are doing evil.    

The commandants of any religion or secular society are unlikely to guarantee a moral crusader stays moral. Even a blanket ban on certain acts like thou shalt not kill does not encompass all. If one cannot kill what about torture starving deprivation of liberty is that permissible? What about killing in self-defense what of pre-emptive self-defense get them before they get you? Is war ever right what about the just war theory that says it is sometimes? 

Utilitarianism that commands us to do the greatest good for the greatest number can justify a great amount of suffering for the minority. 

What if one has a blanket ban on suffering itself to ensure the moral crusader does not do more harm than good?  

What if the suffering is needed now to alleviate greater pain later such as the government making tough financial decisions now to ensure the country has the budget to provide vital services down the track? 

What of the true story of 127 hours. Where a climber had to break his arm to get free? If it is okay to produce that suffering to save his life why not break a few Jewish arms or black arms or female arms or capitalistic or communist arms to help save the lives of a great number of people.  

What if we rely on common sense our ability to rationalize to guide our moral crusader? People usually good people have argued that dropping the A- Bomb on civilians was acceptable during WW2 removing children from Aboriginal parents in Australia without consent torturing terrorists collateral damage from drone strikes toppling democratically elected governments in South America banning gays from getting married following Martin Luther King Jr with non-violence or Malcolm X with violence in the fight for civil rights.

This is not an argument about not doing good? The world needs more good and not the basic level of good given by people who sign up to a philosophy of just being good to their friends and family. This factory setting type of good that some subscribed to is surely not enough. Given the importance of the virtue of doing good caring about the disadvantaged a basic level of good or incidental good that occurs only if one passes by someone in need is not enough. 

Given the misery out there in world also surly means a slightly higher level of good is required. One does not have to take on the responsibility of alleviating all suffering in the world but one does have to take on some of the responsibility which requires more than just factory level settings of good.  

But how to ensure the do goers are not going to pose as much of a threat to humanity as evil doers? Karl Popper recommends tackling concrete evils as opposed to boosting happiness. For utopia is different for different people whereas most people agree to concrete evils out there that need to be abolished such as global poverty.  

Tackling something like poverty does not require murder or deprivation of liberty or human rights abuses. Providing a better job, affordable child care a better education system does not require media suppression and other Orwellian policies disappearances or a benevolent dictator to see it through.

A modern check and balance on our moral crusader may be if their efforts result in Wikileaks featuring their work then you have got a problem. If it requires you to deny publicly what one is doing or shred evidence to lose sleep at night that may be a sign that the policeman not the criminal in the cell is the greater danger. If one appears on 60 minutes in an unfavorable light one may need to step back from the brink.  

Tackling preventable diseases does not require a tyrant or hero who becomes a tyrant nor does it require unrestricted capitalism or socialism and Stalin’s portrait in the lobby. It requires things like affordable health care distribution systems to get medicines to those that need them and taxing smokes to reduce the smoking rate but what of tackling violent crime like murder?

This is a concrete evil that could see the use of deprivation of liberty torture freedom of expression and movement to keep people safe justified and so how does one stop good people doing bad things?  

Effectiveness not logic or morals might be a good benchmark to use when tackling crime. A well done randomized trial could answer the question once and for all. If the great philosophers in history used a randomized trial to answer the big questions then philosophical discussions may have ended in the time of Ancient Greece. 

If the aim is to reduce crime as oppose to look merely as though one is than effective programs need to be carried out not breaches of human rights. Reducing demand for drugs to help stop the drug wars better pay for cops to reduce corruption, lock outs for pubs not prohibition to tackle the high amount of violence created by alcohol. Reducing poverty and these crimes like human trafficking and piracy in which poverty contributes greatly to their existence.

Dealing with mental illness to reduce gun related violence in places like the United States. These require not a dictatorship or oppression or martial law and maybe not even gun control. What it requires is allocating funds to effective programs. Helping to support Imams spread moderate Islam does not require drone strikes and holding people without charges.   

Tackling these concrete evils in this way does not require an internal struggle between what you are doing and what you should be doing. It does not require any of the human rights enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights to be breached. It does not require good people becoming as evil as the people they sought to defeat. It does not require it turning out like Orwell’s Animal Farm where the animals toppled their brutal and greedy masters only to become like them or to twist moral codes. 

All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others. 
One philosophy above others that is worth remembering is that I could be wrong on my take on good and evil and what is permissible. I say this to warn not just you but myself to ensure I don’t become so sure that I am right while everyone else is wrong that I am good while others are evil. 

Maybe we should add to Edmund Burke’s quote the only necessary thing for the triumph for evil is for good men to do nothing…….or to become as evil as the men they are trying to stop.

"A thought experiment about the hard problem of consciousnessIt took me about three years from the moment I learned about the hard problem of consciousness until I finally saw the inevitability of the conclusion it leads to. Although the problem seemed quite ridiculous to me during those three years, now I really don't see how I didn't get the point earlier. Moreover, I don't quite see why it is not immediately clear to other people that the hard problem is just as troubling as the name implies. This is very odd to me, because I can usually sympathize with an opinion I held for a long time myself.

I guess the most I can say is that I didn't even listen to the thought experiments which are traditionally presented in favor of the hard problem, since they seemed like pointless games. However, a particular thought experiment struck me really hard, forcing me to take the issue seriously.

Suppose you are a very powerful being which created our universe. You have no experiences as such, but only can draw conclusions from assumptions, much like a computer can. Suppose you create the universe, and that you know all there is to know about the initial conditions and the laws of nature. We will assume that these laws are deterministic, as it makes the arguments easier.

With all this knowledge, you start to forecast the future and to imagine everything that could happen in your universe. Eventually you would see everything as a movie in your head: the primitive plants performing photosynthesis, a snail slowly eating a leaf, humans building whole societies. Yet all this knowledge would not help you in the least in imagining what seeing the color red would be like. Despite your vast knowledge, you are none the wiser about such mundane things. You will never be able to bridge bridge that gap by knowledge alone.

This way of phrasing the hard problem of consciousness is much more convincing to me. May it is because it seems to me to shine light on the the essentials of the problem only. What do you all think?"
"Ethics in a Post Apocalyptic Setting - A What-If Scenario for Fun!I'm reposting this from /r/gaming because I'm curious how /r/philosphy redditors would answer this in their own subreddit. 

I've played Fallout: New Vegas a number of times now, and I love how many moral choices you're presented with throughout. However, I've noticed myself doing a lot of meta-gaming when it came to how I solved problems. I think this is natural and a lot of people playing a game want to make the decision that ultimately helps them the most (gets them items, money, xp). Whatever role playing they may have considered when creating their character is basically out the window when making decisions of this nature. 

I would like to attempt a pure role playing play-through of New Vegas, but I think it would help a lot to establish what kind of behaviors I'm allowed prior to beginning so I don't have to make shit up as I go along. Much as our society (the Old World) has a moral code of what most people find acceptable behavior, so must a setting like New Vegas. However, these are not always going to match up with Old World values for obvious reasons. Example, if today you found a dead body in the middle of the street, it would not be proper to loot the dead body. It would be considered tampering with a crime scene, etc... However, if placed in a post-apocalyptic world of radiation, starvation, and roaming gangs of violent criminals being *the norm*, I'm pretty sure you or I would not bat an eye at rifling through the deceased's belongings.

So, now that you know what I'm talking about, lets come up with some fairly universal rules of acceptable behavior for survivors wandering the Mojave desert. Forget what the game rewards Karma for, we're not trying to make a saint, we're trying to describe basic practices accepted as necessary for survival. I'll start!

**A)** Responding to any threat of violence with violence is acceptable (there is no public justice system in place to punish someone for assault, rape, or murder)

**B)** Shooting first (sneak attack) when a threat is implied (wild animals, raiders, killer robots) is acceptable 

**C)** Taking anything with no obvious owner (shop keeper, etc...) is acceptable

These are the easy and obvious rules, pre-requisites to basic survival in the Mojave and New Vegas. The bigger questions that need addressed are things like, is Caesar's Legion right? Why? Is it really better to be independent (Yes Man path) or does humanity's best hope of survival actually lie in joining the New California Republic? Or, since Mr. House saved New Vegas during the final hours of the Old World, does he deserve to continue to rule it? Consider these questions from a wasteland ethics perspective and how that would answer them, not your own personal ethics.

Let us get into this!

Other example areas of discussion:

Is there value in salvaging Old World tech, or would this eventually lead to a repetition of what destroyed the Old World? (this is the Brotherhood of Steel perspective)

Now that all governments have been destroyed, is this an opportunity for humanity to continue without them (anarchy / ultra-libertarianism)? Or should a formal government like the NCR be re-established as quickly as possible?"
"Brain - Computer Analogy[Just posted this in another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/aa4p2/assume_intelligent_ais_lets_call_them_robots/c0gm8iq), but would like to get some opinions on the analogy:

Suppose you took a computer back a hundred years and dropped it off with some scientists to figure it out. They're only barely starting to understand electricity, but at least they have it so they can plug it in. They don't know anything about the rest of the computer though, so how long would it take them to figure it out? Looking inside while it's working, they won't be able to get any idea how it works. Some wires go in, spreads the current around some small little black boxies with little wires coming out, big cards & small cards sticking out with more black boxies, a big silver box on its own making sounds now and then.

It would be a total and absolute mystery. How long would it take them to figure out there is a 100 million transistors in the black boxie with a fan on top? How long would it take to figure out what the hell a transistor even is? And all the other components, what they hell do they all do? Inside the hard drive, there are some plates that spin for no reason with a little arm thing moving across it randomly that doesn't even touch it! That doesn't even begin with the higher processes like figuring out how the operating system works without having the source code.

*My god man! There's no way this machine can do all it does just from these little bits and pieces inside it! It must have some kind of **machine soul** in another dimension that is somehow connected to the hardware that actually does the work!!!*

I'm just trying to illustrate that us trying to figure out the brain & consciousness is essentially the same as scientists a hundred years ago trying to figure out a modern computer. It would seem like it's simply impossible for that small box to do all it does. It might even be used as conclusive evidence for strong emergence. How long would it take for them to work it out? Would they even ever work it out? How would they figure out programs without the source code when you have no concept of how even the basic elements of the system work? Probably never until they finally start building their own computers and programs. Would it help at all to figure out how transistors work if the only examples you have is so small they can't even properly be seen with their microscopes? Back to your point, it would seem totally chaotic to them - all that energy flowing in billions of different directions for no apparent reason.

**tl/dr** - How would scientists from 100 years ago be able to explain the (in reality) weakly emergent property of playing Half Life 2 on a computer, when they have no concept of even how transistors work? Aren't we in a similar situation with trying to figure out how the brain work and the emergent property of consciousness?"
"Can killing in the name of good be justified when innocents may also be harmed?During a sleepless night, I typed this out. It is a description of my internal conflict with being a contracted hacker for the government and the morality of my actions. 

**Background Info:**
I am 17. I work for a network security company that does contracting for the government. My work involves gaining access to a specific target using vulnerabilities in consumer devices. Since I do not a have a clearance I am given no information about the target.

**Start:**
I want to know I’m doing the right thing. Because what I do makes me a killer. Not directly, but ultimately what I do may or may not end someone else’s life. Work that I do with law enforcement can put a pedophile behind bars or work with the military can put a bullet through someone’s head in Afghanistan. It wasn’t like this before. Before, it was just the excitement of solving the puzzle, finding that one flaw that would give you unauthorized access. It didn’t feel quite real, at least not until the sudden realization that what I am doing actually affects people’s lives. The realization changes the “I just bypassed the security on that webcam” to “I just got a visual id on the target.” It’s been some months since I realized this and now I can’t stop asking myself the question: “Am I doing the right thing?” 

Personally, I do not believe that our government always makes the right decisions. Our elected officials are people just like us and are likely to make decisions that further their own agenda rather than do the “right” thing. Most of the time, there is no consensus on what the right thing is. There is so much conflict within the government that I cannot believe that without a doubt, the actions it makes are completely justified. What I do to help it can either be good or evil. Did hacking into some foreign computer network help the military kill someone? Maybe. Was he a terrorist? Who knows. I’d like to think that by providing the military with more information, I make it less likely for them to make a mistake, but I can’t be certain of that and I can’t be certain that the target deserved to die. 

So how do I justify my actions to help an entity that punishes people when my faith in its ability to do so fairly is lacking? I have to assume that it makes the correct decisions. I need to tell myself that when my software breaks into someone’s home network, that I am helping society by removing those who cause harm. I tell myself that each network I break into means that there is some little kid won’t be hurt. That one girl won’t have to live the rest of her life in silence and shame because she is scared to speak out. I pray that my work isn’t being abused to help spy on those who are innocent or worse, kill those who are innocent. It’s a huge burden that I place on a single assumption.  

I need to feel verification that I have done the right thing, that even if someone was harmed because of me, it was worth it because many more avoiding suffering. This need makes the words people that say to me have so much more meaning than they intend. Acceptance by others is verification that I have done the right thing while rejection proves that I have made a mistake. Hearing someone say that they trust me puts me in a blissful happiness. On the other hand, the words, “You’re not the right one for me. I just want to be friends” becomes a soul-crushing “You had good intentions, but you have made a terrible mistake and I can’t accept that.” Being aware of my unwarranted translation does nothing to mitigate the feelings it stirs up. I vividly remember a breakup where I was told, “I feel like you are using your depression to take advantage of me.” The shock that put through me was enormous. I had been able to feel like I was doing the right thing by demonizing rapists, pedophiles, generally anyone who takes advantage of others for sex. Now, to be heard that I was one, completely ripped my mind apart. Someone that I cared for did not want to be with me because she thought I was one of them. The rest of the day was spent contemplating quick and painless ways of suicide while a friend ineffectively tried to convince me that it wasn’t true. Honestly, the only thing that saved me was probably the fact that I felt so useless that I couldn’t bring myself to do anything.

Dealing with people has an extra level of difficulty, especially with people who don’t quite understand what I do. It seems that whenever people at school talk about me, the subject is always how much money I make. I have even had several people I do not normally talk to come up to me and inquire about my yearly salary. One such person even friend requested me on Facebook shortly after asking. This question disgusts me. My work decides if people live or die and people’s main concern is gossiping over how much money I make? Is only my pay important? How about catching those pedophiles, is that important? Is it worth the damage I might cause? Am I causing other people’s deaths for the money? I hope not. Just the idea of it sickens me. So I started using a large portion of my paycheck to buy toys for kids in hospitals. I remember when I was learning to program, my brother was in the hospital. The everyday before visiting him, I would frantically be programming a game to let him play on my laptop when I went to visit. He was so excited when he got to play my simple board game. I hope the money I got from my gamble at least brings a smile to others like the one my brother had. At least this helps me hold on to what sanity I have, but the toll this conflict is having on me is becoming more apparent.

I go through most days robotically. I wake up in the morning, go to school, go to work, go home, pass out, then stay up all through the night. Why? Sleep is a curse. I only sleep when my body can no longer handle being awake any longer since my dreams are painful. Some nights I dream of being punished for the fates I’ve brought to others, some nights I dream that I can no longer handle it and kill the ones I know who are guilty, and some nights I dream I am back in the asylum where I belong. If I am lucky, I don’t dream. I am in a different state of mind every day. I may go a few days feeling on top of the world while, on other days, I feel wretched and useless. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone. I can’t stand being unable to control my thoughts and feelings. I can’t help but let my personal relationships be intertwined with my conscience. My aim has always been to protect those who cannot protect themselves and spread happiness to those who suffer. The constant conflict in my mind leaves me lost and confused. I am sorry to those around me that I hurt because I am blind and those who I do not know because I am mistaken. Am I doing the right thing? Did I make the right choice?"
"Anthropic reasoning questionConsider a drone that is being shot at with a missile. It appears reasonable to write drone software so that in the event of survival it would decrease it's estimate of missile's effectiveness, in the precisely same well understood manner as if the missile would say ""bang, you're dead"" instead of destroying the drone. It doesn't matter that the on-board computer would not exist if it had been destroyed and wouldn't conclude anything. Simply not a part of calculation. 

Now, this is pretty similar to John Leslie's Firing Squad analogy, except instead of the human I have a drone which I can program arbitrarily. I effectively argue that in Leslie's Firing Squad, the evidence is to be processed in same manner as if the nerf guns were used.

I'm arguing with some amateur philosopher who seems convinced that this reasoning is ""crazy"" for a human observer (even though he does not believe in soul or the like). I'm myself an applied mathematician and this one is a fairly straightforward problem for design of any sort of robotic drone (Matter of fact I have written game AIs, and everyone routinely assumes that if the program is still running this is evidence that the user has not deliberately exited it). The probabilistic calculations in question are quite straightforward, and are utterly commonplace in all sorts of hardware self-test scenarios. My understanding is that anthropic bias is a much subtler issue arising in different types of probabilistic equations. 

I vaguely recall a variety of anthropic principle that coincides with the reasoning of the drone in my example (and I know philosophers tend to very thoroughly consider such cases), but the name of that variation evades me. Can someone help me with that?"
"On the absurdity of consequentalism by everyone's favorite philosopher: L34derIt seems that it's getting more and more frequent for me to bump into here and see the trolley problem being discussed. What surprises me the most is that there are few who have taken the pains to study the origin of this thought experiment. So what should you care about dates and names and such? This isn't r/history although in a perfect world r/history and r/philosophy would be the same subreddit. 

But the fact remains that the trolley problem was originally conceived as a satire of consequentalist ethics by virtue ethicist Philippa Foot. The trolley problem has since changed into a kind of consequentalist propaganda that seeks to strip ethical philosophy to the bone by making it seem like abstract and frankly ridiculous thought experiments can answer fundamental questions on morality. So if the trolley problem is simplistic and unrealistic then what abstraction are we to choose to model our behavior on. The truth is that there are none because the experiments rely on the premise that you have power over people's lives, lots of power and you should know how to handle that power. Which is simply not the case for the average citizen. He has almost no power and lots of moral expectations to live up to.

To begin with there is one thing clearly wrong with the trolley problem if it is to be understood as a serious attempt at giving insight into our moral compass: Our moral compass although governed by a rational mind is not the Eye of Sauron. In the thought experiment we presume that the acting individual knows the train(potential threat) will not brake, all five(potential victims) will die(since apparently noone survives these sorts of accidents ever) and still despite your eye of omniscience you will see the workers as faceless automatons that you simply have to either save or kill. The joke Philippa Foot is getting at is that consequentalism reduces humans to robots with the value tag '1' hanging from their earrings. It wouldn't be 'wrong' to pull the switch if you cared about the workers and would feel sad about one of them having to die but let's rethink the thought experiment and yes the fat bastard is coming along with us although now i'm freely adding more details just like the other philosophers felt justified in.

So you arrive at the train station and you walk past the five railway workers. You smell something weird while you're walking past them and one of them is crouched up against the wall and it seems like he's injecting something...hmmm, hopefully just some insulin right? Then you spontaneously decide to wander into the control room(whatever i'm not familiar with the infrastructure) which happens to be empty and you can see that a train is fast approaching and is not slowing down. 'FUCK! There's no switch, what do i do?' Then you see the fat man..wait isn't this Gerry Manders, yeah you recognize him from the newspaper. He helped fund dozens of children charities and anti-gang initiatives in Detroit and L.A. He started his own business and hardly keeps a percentage for himself!(although he's a little greedy on the fatty foods) Well he's standing on the edge of the platform and by pushing him onto the rails he'll save the workers or well, you'll save the workers! Full of guilt you start approaching him from behind. Just as you're about to push him he turns around with this big, heart-warming smile full of joy.''Now i couldn't help notice you approaching me good fellow'' he says as he tips his hat and offers you a cigar.

Is this still the same thought experiment? Furthermore, do consequentalists realize that they're not the only ones concerned with consequences? What differentiates Deontologists and Virtue ethicists from consequentalists is that the former seek good consequences from strict conduct or developing one's virtues whereas consequentalists seek it through raw action based on calculations that may or may not be accurate. Does anyone really think Immanuel Kant wasn't concerned about preventing lies and murder when he provided his categorical imperative.?

Although i don't consider the categorical imperative to be perfect is it inconceivable that killing in the name of good can lead to others thinking that feeling justified in killing someone makes it just? The last point that i would like to invoke so that you may finally escape my rant is this: What separates consequentalism from nihilism? 

A consequentalist may berate you for taking incorrect action but can he give a convincing account of why it is incorrect? Will he make reference to human rights as to why the universal value tag earmark(1) is correct and then say that human rights must be broken from time to time in order for them to work. Why not the value tag 0? The nihilist has no pretense, if every rule can be bent there are no rules and trying to maximize or stabilize a population's size is not ethical considerations but calculus.

"I AI is the problem of deciding what people want in advance?Thought about posting this in /r/Artificial, but they don't tolerate speculation too well over there.

How do you design technology that gives people what they need and not what they want? Well you might ask ""What are they trying to do?"" Back when the car was made popular, people might have said they wanted faster horses, but what they really needed was faster *transportation*. I don't think there is a formulaic way to find insights like that. Which means there isn't a way to write a program to do it. 

Creating an Artificial Intelligence (of the Kurzweillian type, that aims to surpass human intelligence, rather than replicate it, for the purpose of designing better tech and better intelligence), In my opinion, amounts to specifying what you (or everyone who uses the tech) want in advance, specifically or abstractly.

Consider that passage in one of Asimov's books (please help me ID it) where the researchers on Mercury tell one of their robots to go out and fix a broken solar panel or something in a very harsh and dangerous environment. The robot gets stuck between wanting to obey the order, and not wanting to die due to the dangerous amount of heat near the broken panel. The *goal* was not specified clearly enough to get the tech past the unforeseen, and undesirable equilibrium.

I hypothesize that the Intelligence of a piece of tech, is limited by how well it's purpose has been specified in advance. If you don't have to tell a program very specifically what you want to get it to perform a specific desired action, it's because someone else has specified it for you, abstractly. In other words, they have defined the abstract class of things you might want, so you don't don't have to provide as much information.

Please, reddit, punch holes in this argument.

EDIT: the title should read ""Is AI...."""
"What are your opinions on a technologically-advanced meritocratical anarchy?We should shape our societies so that only scientists have jobs and are paid well, so that they can reproduce more. That way, we have a society which has incredibly advanced technology and machines do everything for us from helping us sleep to getting our food to building our buildings. Therefore, investment in the industrialization of a country wouldn't be needed, as the machines would replace humans. I'm not talking being lazy and sitting around all day, despite the possibility of this happening. I'm talking about not having to worry about minor details of our lives, and move on to accomplish great things and fulfill dreams.

The point is that so we don't actually have to do any physical labor as a species and can set our minds to doing only what we want instead of what we need. Science would be revolutionized, the entertainment media would grow, and since the economy, industrial, and agricultural sectors would be controlled by machines, politics wouldn't have to side with the ""majority's view"" that we should have governmental control over the economy, our personal lives, and possibly the military. The basis of this argument is that with a technological future like such, we are capable of living together in peace in an anarchical society.

I don't see this happening within the next 50 years, but I sure do hope it happens, and we can live lives we can judge worth living simply because we can accomplish anything and are not limited by any barriers.

Solving the economical, agricultural, and industrial crisis: investing in science and robotics, having less manual human labor, and investing in efficient renewable fuels.

Who knows, we might live forever; and if the euthanasia-requirement topic comes up some time in the future, my counterpoint is that we don't have to die for others to live. We can all live infinitely, and build a unified civilization which colonizes uninhabited planets, and terraforms to sustain life.

We are stardust, aren't we? We might as well spread the dust among the stars.

"Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution.Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution. **[This was written BEFORE the Occupy movement began]**


February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"A Human Brain is not a ComputerIt troubles me that a lot of modern thinkers believe that the human brain is a computer. It has become part of the zeitgeist that we are going to achieve true artificial intelligence otherwise known as Strong AI and that the computer will become self aware like man is. But I believe that this thinking is partly due to the current limited knowledge we have of how the brain really operates as ,the limits to our understanding of artificial intelligence as well as the lack of a precise mathematical language to properly describe the mechanics of our own consciousness. 

But from what we do currently know about computation we can say that it all depends of definite rules. A computer program is governed by these rules. A computer as such cannot move beyond the rules that govern it. If we consider creativity to be a human trait. And if we consider this creativity to be indeed an act of creating something new from nothing, then we can deduce that no program can be written to produce creative artefacts. Think of a novel as an example. If the ideas and stories in that novel are truly new, then no computer program can be written to produce it. As a computer program has to rely on rules that will determine the structure of a novel.

Another objection I have against the idea of Strong AI, is that advocates dismiss the homunculus agent of our minds. This is how we perceive the world, through a first person experience that drives our desires expresses our thoughts and basically conducts an internal dialogue within us. To know how Strong AI advocates view an AI robot, try to mute out your internal thoughts and guide yourself by only what you see and by reasoning outputs. You will not be able to. The AI advocates respond that the first person experience is an illusion. Yet no human being can experience himself without this experience. And it is this experience who is the creative author of our lives. He produces creative ideas. He produces the will in us. At the same time, no investigation of computers have been able to produce a place where such an illusion can exist within it. A computer is thus a turing machine that operates mechanically without this first person experience.

I believe that given that experience if we want to model a human being as a computer, we will have to model him as a system consisting of a Turing Machine and a programmer who is programming this Turing machine. The programmer is the first person experience and is not a program or a Turing Machine. This all reduces to this system to a Human being and not a computer. A computer doesn’t have this first person programmer and cannot produce it on its own.

But because of the lack of a mathematical language that describes consciousness thinkers are able to speculate about he brain being a computer with no way of knowing for sure unless they try to build one. And even if they fail they will believe that they need a more powerful computer. It is only when we have a precise language to describe consciousness that we will truly be able to distinguish between Man and Machine.

"Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution.Revolutionary Philosophy is Revolution. **[This was written BEFORE the Occupy movement began]**


February 25, 2011 


Assuming philosophy should be relevant to the way we choose to live our lives, three questions guide this paper. What are some moral foundations for revolution? Do you realize what is happening? Are you willing to do anything about it?

If we assume that human well-being is at the crux of what makes something a moral or ethical issue we have to clarify what we mean by human well-being (henceforth “flourishing”). A definition of flourishing centering on the individual would lead one to conclude that it is or depends on egoism; correspondingly, a definition focused exclusively on others leads to the conclusion that flourishing is or is dependent on altruism. Also, as Euthryphro’s dilemma showed, we also cannot rely on a higher power to provide a legitimate definition of flourishing for us. However, a glance around at how society functions leads me to believe that flourishing is neither exclusively egoistic nor altruistic. Simply put, the individual and society are interdependent.

A strong form of egoism, characterized by Ayn Rand’s objectivism, can be dismissed as unjustifiable.  James Rachels provides a strong argument of refutation. Rachels says that ethical egoism is unacceptably arbitrary in two steps. For the interests of one group to be privileged over others is unacceptably arbitrary without some important justificatory difference between them. Ethical egoism arbitrarily assigns greater importance to the interests of the individual over the interests of others without appealing to a general difference between others and oneself to justify difference in treatment.

Luckily extreme altruism is not the only other option, as Rand would have us believe, because extreme altruism is also unsupportable. Extreme altruism places no value whatsoever on the individual. It is a totalitarian extreme, because under its doctrine no individual would ever be justified in pursuing her/his own self-interest for its own sake. The concept of human rights becomes utterly meaningless, and furthermore it seems to lead directly to the most brutal utilitarian calculus. The state is everything and the individual is nothing. In fact, this was the exact project of Nazi Germany. Every act ordered and undertaken was justified by contributing to the glory of the Third Reich. That Germany was defeated is not proof under this moral doctrine that their choices were morally wrong, only that they were imprudent.

To begin to grasp what human flourishing is, we need to know what kind of creature a human is. A basic starting point is that humans are evolved creatures. Evolution is fundamentally about competition for resources. In this competition there is a very strong impetus for cooperation to develop. Between two individuals competing for a specific resource it is preferable to each to monopolize the resource, but there is a life-threatening risk that they will be left high and dry. The best combined outcome is for both to cooperate and share. Once there is a foundation for cooperation, there is pressure for more and better cooperation because groups that cooperate better and with more individuals can out-compete other groups and so on. Jonathan Haidt pointed out that this is witnessed evolutionarily in the development of chromosomes from single gene replicators, prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, single cellular to multi-cellular organisms, individuals to groups, and—in humans—tribes to armies, nations, and empires. Of course there is a free rider issue that must be addressed, but because of cooperation’s immense benefits it has been relatively successfully combated. For example, see Pojman’s discussions of the types of birds called “Suckers,” “Cheaters” and “Grudgers.”[i] The reason who we are as humans is so important is because ought implies capability, and where this rule is flouted there is significant human cost. We know for example that at the granular level the emotional interdependency we call love creates physical dependency that can cause physical and emotional withdrawal upon its cessation, and behaves in many ways similarly to drug addiction.

To a certain extent then humans can be seen collectively as similar in certain respects to termites and other ultra-social insects. We have evolved to be adapted to a community that we have collectively built and therefore have internal mechanisms (like a conscience) that on average will reward us for mutually beneficial behavior. Once we have realized that “no man is an island” and that the community depends on the individual as the individual depends on the community, we can see that human flourishing or well-being is the egoism that leads to altruism. We are all passengers on “spaceship earth.” Seeing the world through a zero sum lens is ultimately counterproductive and in an increasingly interdependent global community with problems that need to be addressed globally it is only a matter of time until the most efficient and possibly only route to human flourishing is sought and reached: global human cooperation and the end of war.

It is of absolutely fundamental importance for the vast majority of the human species to realize our common humanity. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives depend on it. As technology continues to give each of us more power, and the corresponding effect that we have on other persons and the world expands, the question of what we choose to do with our freedom will decide more than just the fate of our species, but the biosphere as a whole. Since the Cold War era, it has been within the capability of our species to destroy itself and take most of the planet with us. And we are currently on a path of self-destruction being led by the greatest power on Earth that has been hijacked by elite interests that have succeeded in privatizing profits and externalizing costs at an unfathomable scale.

Of fundamental importance to this project is the virtually total relinquishment of any claims to absolute truth or knowledge. Such claims are false relics from an evolutionary history that valued greater cohesion and solidarity in groups of humans competing with other groups of humans for resources for themselves and their progeny. Religious belief is completely natural, and spirituality is woven into the fabric of what it can mean to be human. However religious or ideological claims that arrogate a monopoly on the truth by definition create divisions between in-groups and out-groups. The in-group must include the entire species as a minimum; history has shown us strife as an alternative and that strife will pale in comparison to the fate that awaits us if we fail to recognize the humanity in each person unconditionally.

The nature of knowledge is fundamentally tentative even with the broadest consensus of rational thought based on evidence, assertions to knowledge beyond that which cannot be verified or evidentially supported must be recognized as speculation, and as such provide no grounds from which to dehumanize or murder another human being. The spread of memes/ideas by force is a sign of intellectual weakness. To the contrary we could recognize that Gödel proved formal systems are fundamentally incapable of completion, and begin to come to grips with beginning to form a world that truly brings the limitations of knowledge to its core. No perfect being exists, every single one of us makes mistakes, and therefore there is nothing more dangerous to approaching the truth than the suppression of dissent.

Some might object that the end of war is unrealistic and idealistic. I would point out first that the next big step in cooperation probably has always seemed inconceivable. I think it is less inconceivable than a nation state must seem to someone in a jungle tribe.

Furthermore, we as a species have developed the ability to literally destroy the entire planet. If war had broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. it is an open question whether the human race would have survived. If there is one moral issue from whence all others spring it is the survival of the human species (of people to do the moralizing). Ending war seems necessary but insufficient.

Famine relief, for example, has to be about more than minimizing the suffering of humans no different from ourselves, it has to resolve the structural injustices and inequities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism that disadvantage the global south and ethnic minorities within wealthy nations because in addition to  the suffering there is a terrific global opportunity cost (even in the economic sense) in concentrating power at the expense of the maximization of opportunity for every human individual. True wealth is created by innovation, innovation requires innovative minds, and innovative minds require the education and leisure to pursue their interests. Maximizing the capabilities of each individual, by definition maximizes the capabilities of society.

Something is a moral matter then when it relates to the interdependence of the human species, the associated fact that the survival of the human species depends on this interdependence, and the maximization of the potential of the human species depends on maximizing the potential of every individual human. Martin Luther King Jr. said it better than anyone else, “We are caught in a an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” But we do no even have to be certain of this.

Acknowledging that dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, is there a place for uncertainty? Indeed, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?

What might “updated software,” so to speak, practically get us? To the extent that as a species some paths are more wise than others, one suggestion is wiki government. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google in his advance praise for the eponymous book says, “The Internet has taught us that good ideas come from everywhere. Wiki Government translates that lesson for policy makers. With a compelling blend of high theory and practical know-how, Beth Noveck explains how political institutions can directly engage the public to solve complex problems and create a better democracy.”

“Using technology to drive law reform is explicitly evolutionary. We can iterate new versions of the social and institutional ‘operating system,’ but instead of Windows 1.0 and 2.0, we are striving to create better decisionmaking practices. The speed with which we can update software—as opposed to the long delays often involved in updating laws—allows us to respond efficiently to empirical data. Technologists believe in rough consensus, running code. Try something, see how it works, iterate, and try again.”[ii]

 

It should be obvious that the direct participation of relevant knowledgeable citizenry in an active and responsive decisionmaking process would be able to produce better results than the rather anemic intermittent voting for so-called “representatives.” Technology can serve as a bridge to allow public participation to directly create public policy. “Collaborative governance is an idea whose time has come.”[iii]

We can even have good reasons to expect what some of the results of better democracy would look like. We now know for example, and Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level, make it abundantly clear, that inequality is a common thread in almost the entirety of our set of social problems,

“On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable “low” end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable “high” end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.”[iv]

 

High inequality results in high numbers for social ills, and low inequality correspondingly leads to significantly fewer social problems. They do discuss in detail how social inequality can be linked to everything from obesity rates to teen pregnancy. However, they do not make any explicit connection between their findings and the degree of meaningful democracy a country possesses. It seems likely that Scandinavian countries are more democratic in general, and the U.S., some of you might have noticed, shows serious signs of having become a banana republic.

The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government—a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF’s staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we’re running out of time.[v]

 

So the next step is taking back our country. For those of you in denial of the desperate need to do so consider,

50 million Americans are now living in poverty, which is the highest poverty rate in the industrialized world; 30 million Americans are in need of work; Five million American families foreclosed upon, 15 million expected by 2014; 50% of US children will now use a food stamp during childhood; Soaring budget deficits in states across the country and a record high national debt, with austerity measures on the way; [and] Record-breaking profits and bonuses for [the financial oligarchy].[vi]

 

Glenn Greenwald quotes The Atlantic,

“‘Squeezing the oligarchs, though, is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging-market governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or — here’s a classic Kremlin bailout technique — the assumption of private debt obligations by the government. Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile, needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary working folk — at least until the riots grow too large.’

The real question is whether the American public is too apathetic and trained into submission for that to ever happen.”[vii]

 

Elizabeth Warren of Harvard is warning us of the coming collapse of the American middle class. Two income families today have less money after fixed expenses than single income families did a generation ago. We all know families that have dealt with divorce, but we may not have realized that we know more families that have gone through bankruptcy.[viii]

 

American civic education requires a transformative breakthrough. Current US wars are unlawful to an Orwellian degree. The US economy is transferring unprecedented wealth of trillions of dollars every year to a financial elite within corporate cartels that have captured their government regulators. Civic education in both of these areas is crippled by colluding political and corporate propaganda.

These are factual claims easily verified as objective data, and substantiated by recognized experts within the Harvard community.[ix]

 

Corporations are not humans, and must be stripped of all human rights. The granting of human rights to a super-human psychopathic artificial intelligence severely diminishes, if not drowns out, the actual human rights of the living and breathing human creatures inhabiting the planet. The ravaging of the peoples and places of the planet is directly related to the artificial maintenance of the economic sphere as the highest power.

People and land and natural resources are not commodities, we have not been created for the market. The market economy has never been as pristine as economic conceptions would indicate. Economics cannot be meaningfully discussed without addressing its relation to socio-political life. The American Dream is a lie. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that each of us is just around the corner from being rich, this nation has markedly less actual social mobility than European countries like Germany, Denmark, or Norway. The American Dream has been built on the backs of slave labor, dependent on continued preservation of desperation to keep wages down and people willing to work for next to nothing, and it is already being replaced by the European Dream. We are in the “jaws of death,” productivity continues to rise and real wages continue to fall. This is not an aspect of China’s that we want to be emulating. The two party stranglehold of political power has for all intents and purposes successfully curtailed real democratic change.

I am not sure how much hope of success we are justified in having in a short enough time frame to stave of the next great depression, especially considering that even Ralph Nader’s most recent book is titled Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us. If that does not pan out, maybe some day super-intelligent robots will save us from ourselves, but of course we cannot count on either. It could be wise to remember that wisdom is a work in progress, but also to remember that sometimes, if we are going to value human life, wisdom requires action.

What are you willing to do? Are you willing to stand up like the Tunisians, to stand up like the Egyptians? What are people waiting for. We have every reason to believe that we are beyond the point of no return in this country. When the political and economic elites are above the law, while its full weight crashes down on the weakest and most downtrodden, and the righteous among us, what has the law become when it is no longer universal?

“[T]o review the contemporary rules governing the Rule of Law in the U.S.:

* If you torture people or eavesdrop on Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, you receive Look-Forward Imperial Immunity.

* If you shoot and kill unarmed rescuers of the wounded while occupying their country and severely wound their unarmed children sitting in a van — or if you authorize that conduct — your actions are commended.

* If you help wreck the world economy with fraud and cause hundreds of millions of people untold suffering, you collect tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

* If you disclose to the world evidence of war crimes, government lawbreaking, or serious corruption, or otherwise embarrass the U.S., you will be swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and face decades in prison.”[x]

“Imagine a parallel universe where the Great Crash of 2008 was followed by a Tea Party of a very different kind. Enraged citizens gather in every city, week after week—to demand the government finally regulate the behavior of corporations and the superrich, and force them to start paying taxes. The protesters shut down the shops and offices of the companies that have most aggressively ripped off the country. The swelling movement is made up of everyone from teenagers to pensioners. They surround branches of the banks that caused this crash and force them to close, with banners saying, You Caused This Crisis. Now YOU Pay.

As people see their fellow citizens acting in self-defense, these tax-the-rich protests spread to even the most conservative parts of the country. It becomes the most-discussed subject on Twitter. Even right-wing media outlets, sensing a startling effect on the public mood, begin to praise the uprising, and dig up damning facts on the tax dodgers.

Instead of the fake populism of the Tea Party, there is a movement based on real populism. It shows that there is an alternative to making the poor and the middle class pay for a crisis caused by the rich. It shifts the national conversation. Instead of letting the government cut our services and increase our taxes, the people demand that it cut the endless and lavish aid for the rich and make them pay the massive sums they dodge in taxes.

This may sound like a fantasy—but it has all happened. The name of this parallel universe is Britain. As recently as this past fall, people here were asking the same questions liberal Americans have been glumly contemplating: Why is everyone being so passive? Why are we letting ourselves be ripped off? Why are people staying in their homes watching their flat-screens while our politicians strip away services so they can fatten the superrich even more?”[xi]

 

Let’s do this. Johann Hari even has a ten step guide laid out.[xii] If we aren’t active participants, we are passive observers. As Howard Zinn has explained there is no being neutral on a moving train. Especially when looking ahead makes it clear the tracks are out.

Our species is in a race with itself the stakes of which have truly never been higher. If current trends continue a middle ground will grow less feasible, and we will be dependent on the fulfillment of the singularity hypothesis—that technological development will lead to a society not understandable, even in principle, to the current human society—to avoid one apocalyptic scenario for the possibility of several other technologically oriented apocalyptic scenarios. Be that as it may, a potential apocalypse is better than a certain one. But there are very serious problems with letting a small elite agenda maintain control in the transition to the trans- and post-human future. Just as technology gives everyone more power as it reaches everyone, it gives a disproportionate amount of power, at least temporarily, to those who wield new technologies first. If technological development is truly on an exponential curve, the point will inevitably come in society with a steep social gradient that those in power will achieve first the technological capability to hold the rest of humanity at their whim. The technological issues are really a known, unknown unknown. As we approach the singularity the number of black swan events will approach infinity. For all I know super-human intelligence will save humanity. Whether immanently or externally, by augmented human or by robotic AI, we cannot predict, but any combination of these seem within the realm of possibility.

First we have to survive the current headlong rush toward collective suicide via the destruction of the biosphere’s life support systems. In both cases (the current global crisis and the singularity), it seems the likelihood of survival would increase if power became as decentralized and robust as possible without diminishing the possibility for swift, practical, and unified action; the only form of governance that I could imagine fulfilling this seemingly impossible role would be something along the lines of a wikigovernment, made possible for the first time by technological advances.

This is where I think the practical wisdom of a living philosophy will lead us. Maybe as the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh says in his book Being Peace, “The most basic precept of all is to be aware of what we do, what we are, each minute. Every other precept will follow from that.”[xiii]

[vi] “We, as a population, have been acting against our own interests and fighting amongst ourselves, while the Economic Elite, who control our society and media system, are left unquestioned and unchallenged, operating behind the scenes, beyond the spotlight, above the law, concentrating wealth and resources, at our expense, in unprecedented fashion.

Other than to create and control popular opinion and keep us politically passive, the mainstream media exists to keep people consuming and spending their hard-earned money. That is the bottom line.

Every time you turn on the TV, you have to realize that the entire mass media system is an elaborate psychological operation to keep you passive and make you feel secure in spending your money. That’s why TV pundits and talking heads are paid huge salaries; they are experts in duping us and playing us for fools. We are all being played. We aren’t free citizens; we are indebted wage slaves. That may sound much too harsh for a population that has been propagandized for hours a day, every day of our lives, but it is the truth. As the brilliant John Dewey said, “We live exposed to the greatest flood of mass suggestion that any people has ever experienced.”

Who needs reality when you have American Idol, Disneyland and celebrity sex scandals?

Until we can block out these distractions and face reality, our future and living standards will continue to spiral downward.

. . .

I know the game is rigged against us, but I also know that we ultimately have the power. We are 99% of the population. It’s just a matter of organizing together and exercising our will. It comes down to our ability to inform and inspire our family, friends and neighbors. It comes down to us overcoming our own passive unwillingness to STAND UP for our own rights, which is part of the reason we are in this crisis to begin with. We are at a point in American history where the stakes have never been higher. I wish we could just turn away and ignore it, but I know we can’t. Our very way of life is under attack. It is the very unfortunate reality of our current crisis.

Will we WAKE UP and acknowledge this, or will we continue to sleepwalk in ignorance to a slow death?”http://ampedstatus.com/the-financial-oligarchy-reigns-democracys-death-spiral-from-greece-to-the-united-states

"""The Symbol Grounding Problem"" (Floridi 2011) [x-post from /r/philosophyOfInfo]Luciano Floridi has offered a solution to the symbol grounding problem by identifying a condition that must be met in order to satisfy the SGP, called the ""Z-condition"", and claiming that no existing computational model satisfies the Z-condition.

What follows is a summary of chapter six of ""The Philosophy of Information"", but please note that the majority of this content is contained in the following self-contained PDF (so you don't need to read the book or really be familiar with the Philosophy of Information to join in this discussion):

http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2542/1/sgpcrfyr.pdf

Because this is of interest to the larger philosophy community, I am cross posting the entirety of the chapter summary (which is almost a word-for-word duplicate of the pdf), but again note that all of the necessary information is contained in the above PDF. Since this is cross-posted to multiple subreddits, I invite you to join us in the main discussion thread at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyOfInfo/comments/2v3oyl/chapter_6_discussion_thread_the_symbol_grounding/

SUMMARY

- Floridi wants to show ""what it means for data to be meaningful and for meaningful data to be truthful"", and that all 
- He introduces the ""Zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition), as the requirement that must be satisfied by a strategy in order to provide a valid solution of the SGP [symbol grounding problem, previously referred to in this book as the data grounding problem]"".

6.1 INTRODUCTION

- SGP - ""How can the data, constituting semantic information, acquire their meaning in the first place? ... The SGP concerns the possibility of specifying *precisely how* a formal symbol system can *autonomously* elaborate its own semantics for the symbols (data) that it manipulates and do so *from scratch*, by interacting with its environment and other formal symbol systems.""
- ""the difficulty is not (or at least, not just) merely grounding the symbols or data somehow successfully, as if all we were looking for were the implementation of some sort of internal look-up table ... the interpretation of the symbols (data) must be *intrinsic* to the symbol system itself, it cannot be *extrinsic,* that is, *parasitic* on the fact that the symbols (data) have meaning for, or are provided by, an interpreter."" (135) 
- He says ""all approaches seek to ground the symbols through the sensorimotor capacities of the artificial agents involved. The strategies differ in the methods used to elaborate the data obtained from the sensorimotor experiences, and in the role (if any) assigned to the elaboration of the data representations ... [but] none of the strategies can be said to offer a *valid* solution to the SGP. We shall see that this does not mean that they are theoretically flawed or uninteresting, nor that they cannot work, when technically implemented. The conclusion is rather that, conceptually, insofar as they seem successful, such strategies either fail to address the SGP or circumvent it, by implicitly presupposing its solution and begging the question."" (135)

6.2 THE SYMBOL GROUNDING PROBLEM

- The challenge posed by the SGP is:
	a) No form of innatism is allowed; no semantic resources can magically be presupposed as being pre-installed in the artificial agent (AA)
	b) No form of externalism is allowed; no semantic resources should be uploaded from the 'outside' by some *deus ex machina* already semantically proficient
	c) The AA may have its own capacities and resources to be able to ground its symbols.
- These three conditions are hereafter referred to as the Zero-semantic commitment condition (Z-condition).
- ""These three conditions only exclude the possibility that such resources may be semantic in the first place"" (137).

6.3 THE REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- This approach ""considers the conceptual and categorical representations, elaborated by an AA as the meanings of the symbols used by that AA. The problem is that ""the available representations---whether categorical or perceptual---succeed in grounding the symbols used by an AA only at the price of begging the question. We shall see that their elaboration, and hence availability, presuppose precisely those semantic capacities or resources that the approach is trying to show to be autonomously evolvable by an AA in the first place."" (138) 
- Harnad's (1990) hybrid model is examined first. If an AA using the hybrid model, which he calls 'Perc', uses say, neural networks to take in perceptual data and create conceptual categories such as 'quadruped animal', the conceptual categories could be considered the meanings of Perc's symbols. But Floridi notes that if the neural network uses supervised learning, it requires an external source of labeled training data and violates part (b) of the Z-condition. If the neural net is unsupervised, then the networks ""still need to have *built-in biases* and feature-detectors in order to reach the desired output. ... Moreover, unsupervised or self-organizing networks, once they have been trained, still need to have their output checked to see whether the obtained structures make any sense with respect to the input data space. This difficult process of validation is carried out externally by a supervisor [which is] entirely *extrinsic*."" **See note 1 in the discussion section below for my take on this.**
- What about an approach that constructs categories automatically given similarities between data? Floridi likens this to a move made by Berkeley in criticism of Locke, and says it still fails: ""how is the class of horses (the data space) put together in the first place, without any semantic capacity to elaborate the general idea ... of 'horse' to begin with? And how is a particular specimen of horse privileged over all the others as being the particular horse that could represent all the others, without presupposing some semantic capacities? And finally, how does one know that what makes that representation of a particular horse the representation of a universal horse is not, for example, the whiteness instead of the four-legged nature of the represented horse?""
- Another representationalist approach is that of Mayo (2003), whose *functional model* of AA shows that AAs can elaborate concepts ""in such a way as to be able to ground even abstract names."" Because data always underdetermine their structure, categories are interpreted as ""task-specific sets that collect representations according to their practical function. Symbols are formed in order to solve specific task-oriented problems in particular environments."" For example, ""an AA can generalize the meaning of the symbol 'victory' if, according to Mayo, 'victory' is not rigidly connected to a specific occurrence of a single event but derives its meaning from the representation of the intersection of all the occurrences of 'victory' in different task-specific sets of various events, such as 'victory' in chess, in tennis, [etc]"".
- Floridi claims that Mayo (2003) still fails the Z-condition because it relies on initial representations (Mayo's ""functional criteria"") which the AA already has access to---thus violating part (a) of the Z-condition.
- Sun (2000) proposes an intentional model which builds on a Heideggerian dichotomy of being-in-the-world and being-with-the-world. ""According to Sun, representations do not stand for the corresponding perceived objects, but rather for the uses that an AA can make of these objects as means to ends."" Sun has a first/bottom level of learning, and a second/top level of learning, with qualitatively different processing mechanisms and knowledge sets, which complement each other.
- But again, Floridi claims, the Z condition is breached already because Sun's approach has ""innate biases or built-in constraints and predispositions which also depend on the (ontogenetic and phylogenetic) history of agent world interaction"".
- Sun's model, called CLARION, employs Q-learning (which is based on reinforcement learning) **(See note 2)**. Floridi notes ""the algorithm works only if the (solution of the) problem can be modelled and executed in a finite time ... it is already clear that, by adopting the Q-learning algorithm, the intentional model is importing from the outside the very condition that allows CLARION to semanticize, since tasks, goals, success, [etc.] are all established by the programmer.""

6.4 THE SEMI-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Semi-representationalist approaches are also representationalist in nature, but deal with the AA's use of its representations by ""replying on principles imported from behaviour-based robotics.""
- Davidsson (1993) says that a description has three parts:
	1) designator - the name (symbol) used to refer to a category;
	2) epistemological representation - used to recognize instances of a category;
	3) inferential representation - a collection of all that is known about a category and its members and can be used to make predictions or infer non-perceptual information.
- Davidsson discusses two paradigms of machine learning: learning by observation (basically unsupervised learning, which Floridi says relies on a programmer to provide ""well-selected description entities""), and learning from examples (which Floridi says not only requires a trainer to select examples to learn from, but also ""presupposes a set of explicitly pre-classified (by the human teacher) examples of the categories to be acquired."" Thus Davidsson's strategy fails.
- Rosenstein and Cohen (1998) try to use a bottom-up process (perception -> symbolic thought), by using a ""method of delays"" allowing the AA to store perceptual data as-is (thus avoiding external semantic committments), a predictive semantics, and an unsupervised learning process which elaborates the semantics. It plots data on a cartesian coordinate system, thus constructing a ""cartesian representation"". But ""this 'Cartesian' semantic framework is entirely extraneous to the AA, either being presumed to be there (innatism) or, more realistically, having been superimposed by the programmer. ... the very interpretation of the data, provided by the actions, as information of such and such a kind of Cartesian coordinate system is, by itself, a crucial semantic step, based on extrinsic criteria.""

6.5 THE NON-REPRESENTATIONALIST APPROACH

- Non-representationalist approaches do not have symbolic representations (at least not in the localist, explicit sense), but for such approaches ""the SGP is merely postponed rather than avoided. ... [I]f it is to develop even an elementary protolanguage and some higher cognitive capacities, it will have to manipulate some symbols, but then the question of their semantic grounding presents itself anew."" **See note 3 below**.
- Floridi recalls the classic papers by Brooks (Brooks 1990,1991) on embodied/situated cognition.
- In his criticism of Billard and Dautenhahn (1999)'s DRAMA system, he notes that it has ""a reliance on neural networks, which incurs the same problems highlighted in section 6.3.1"". **(see note 4 below)**.

CONCLUSION

- ""(the semantic capacity to generate) representations cannot be presupposed without begging the question. Yet abandoning any reference to representations means accepting a dramatic limit to what an AA may be able to achieve semantically"". Instead Floridi introduces seven features that a valid solution to the SGP will need to combine:
1. a bottom-up, sensorimotor approach to the grounding problem;
2. a top-down feedback approach that allows the harmonization of top-level grounded symbols and bottom-level, sensorimotor interactions with the environment;
3. the availability of some sort of representational capacities in the AA;
4. the availability of some sort of categorical/abstracting capacities in the AA;
5. the availability of some sort of communication capacities among AAs in order to ground the symbols diachronically and avoid the Wittgensteinian problem of a 'private language';
6. an evolutionary approach in the development of 1-5;
7. the satisfaction of the Z condition in the development of 1-6."" (161)




DISCUSSION TOPICS

**Note 1** I've seen similar criticisms of solutions to the SGP before where the ""biases"" of some learning algorithm were taken to be signs of the programmer putting semantic information into the system and thus violating the SGP. But this is entirely too nit-picky in my opinion. *Of course* there are biases in any learning algorithm; real-life brains have biases that follow from their constructions: the minimum/maximum firing rate of human neurons, the biologically-determined connectivity between certain parts of the brain, etc. If I created a computer simulation to exactly model the human brain down to the neurobiological level, then nobody could reasonably accuse me of imparting semantic information into that simulation, would they?
And Floridi's statement that unsupervised networks need to have their output checked and therefore they violate the Z-condition is problematic---sparse autoencoders, for example, can learn representations given low-level data by performing their own checks, on their own generated representations. Yes, those checks are subjected to a mathematical error metric that is encoded by a human, but once the formula is encoded once it never has to be changed no matter how many representations are generated---more akin to the constraints set by the physical properties of the brain and neurons themselves!

**Note 2** Ron Sun's solution is classified as representationalist, and then closes the chapter with seven features which presumably he believes are not met with Sun's CLARION architecture. I am extremely familiar with Ron Sun's work; in fact I have published papers with him in the past, and I can tell you this: The majority of Floridi's criticisms in this chapter are based on a 10-year-old misunderstanding of what CLARION can and does do (which is 1-6, and likely 7). 

**Note 3** Does the symbol grounding problem still apply when dealing with representations that use symbols which are not declarative knowledge (knowledge *that*), but rather procedural knowledge (knowledge of *how*)? In the human brain, neurons can be said to have a symbolic state (either firing or not firing) *at a certain level of description*, but this level of description is not explicitly used by the human agent, rather the human behaves *in accordance with* behaviors whose state is set by the states of the neurons. This is quite different than behaving *because* some symbolic reasoning took place.

**Note 4** Now Floridi seems to be treating the use of neural networks as if he has performed a mathematical proof-style reduction to a previously solved problem: simply having a neural network now is sufficient to declare that the system violates the Z-condition? This case is not quite made (see my mention of sparse autoencoder networks). Am I missing something?"

The modern day philosopher Peter Singer goes on to argue that “in fact since we are more on guard against the latter, the danger from the former may be the greater”. 
It is of great concern that the ethically motivated may pose a greater threat to us than those clearly marked evil. It is of even greater concern that it seems that most philosophies moral codes and rational thoughts can be bent twisted and distorted to make the most evil of acts seem justified.  

Look at the noble task of trying to create utopia and what that lead to when the Khmer Rouge tried to create an agrarian utopia resulting in millions being killed in Cambodia. Karl Popper argued that trying to achieve an utopian society can lead to violence as the view people have of utopia differ and to keep people marching to the same vision when rationality does not work violence may have to be employed.  

Even a moral code for Robots such as Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics that forbids them from harming humans can be perverted. 

In the movie I Robots the robots enslave the human race and their justification for doing so, humans are self-destructive {hard to argued with that} and so they are protecting humans here from themselves by enslaving them. They are in fact keeping within the three laws just as good people tell themselves when they are doing evil.    

The commandants of any religion or secular society are unlikely to guarantee a moral crusader stays moral. Even a blanket ban on certain acts like thou shalt not kill does not encompass all. If one cannot kill what about torture starving deprivation of liberty is that permissible? What about killing in self-defense what of pre-emptive self-defense get them before they get you? Is war ever right what about the just war theory that says it is sometimes? 

Utilitarianism that commands us to do the greatest good for the greatest number can justify a great amount of suffering for the minority. 

What if one has a blanket ban on suffering itself to ensure the moral crusader does not do more harm than good?  

What if the suffering is needed now to alleviate greater pain later such as the government making tough financial decisions now to ensure the country has the budget to provide vital services down the track? 

What of the true story of 127 hours. Where a climber had to break his arm to get free? If it is okay to produce that suffering to save his life why not break a few Jewish arms or black arms or female arms or capitalistic or communist arms to help save the lives of a great number of people.  

What if we rely on common sense our ability to rationalize to guide our moral crusader? People usually good people have argued that dropping the A- Bomb on civilians was acceptable during WW2 removing children from Aboriginal parents in Australia without consent torturing terrorists collateral damage from drone strikes toppling democratically elected governments in South America banning gays from getting married following Martin Luther King Jr with non-violence or Malcolm X with violence in the fight for civil rights.

This is not an argument about not doing good? The world needs more good and not the basic level of good given by people who sign up to a philosophy of just being good to their friends and family. This factory setting type of good that some subscribed to is surely not enough. Given the importance of the virtue of doing good caring about the disadvantaged a basic level of good or incidental good that occurs only if one passes by someone in need is not enough. 

Given the misery out there in world also surly means a slightly higher level of good is required. One does not have to take on the responsibility of alleviating all suffering in the world but one does have to take on some of the responsibility which requires more than just factory level settings of good.  

But how to ensure the do goers are not going to pose as much of a threat to humanity as evil doers? Karl Popper recommends tackling concrete evils as opposed to boosting happiness. For utopia is different for different people whereas most people agree to concrete evils out there that need to be abolished such as global poverty.  

Tackling something like poverty does not require murder or deprivation of liberty or human rights abuses. Providing a better job, affordable child care a better education system does not require media suppression and other Orwellian policies disappearances or a benevolent dictator to see it through.

A modern check and balance on our moral crusader may be if their efforts result in Wikileaks featuring their work then you have got a problem. If it requires you to deny publicly what one is doing or shred evidence to lose sleep at night that may be a sign that the policeman not the criminal in the cell is the greater danger. If one appears on 60 minutes in an unfavorable light one may need to step back from the brink.  

Tackling preventable diseases does not require a tyrant or hero who becomes a tyrant nor does it require unrestricted capitalism or socialism and Stalin’s portrait in the lobby. It requires things like affordable health care distribution systems to get medicines to those that need them and taxing smokes to reduce the smoking rate but what of tackling violent crime like murder?

This is a concrete evil that could see the use of deprivation of liberty torture freedom of expression and movement to keep people safe justified and so how does one stop good people doing bad things?  

Effectiveness not logic or morals might be a good benchmark to use when tackling crime. A well done randomized trial could answer the question once and for all. If the great philosophers in history used a randomized trial to answer the big questions then philosophical discussions may have ended in the time of Ancient Greece. 

If the aim is to reduce crime as oppose to look merely as though one is than effective programs need to be carried out not breaches of human rights. Reducing demand for drugs to help stop the drug wars better pay for cops to reduce corruption, lock outs for pubs not prohibition to tackle the high amount of violence created by alcohol. Reducing poverty and these crimes like human trafficking and piracy in which poverty contributes greatly to their existence.

Dealing with mental illness to reduce gun related violence in places like the United States. These require not a dictatorship or oppression or martial law and maybe not even gun control. What it requires is allocating funds to effective programs. Helping to support Imams spread moderate Islam does not require drone strikes and holding people without charges.   

Tackling these concrete evils in this way does not require an internal struggle between what you are doing and what you should be doing. It does not require any of the human rights enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights to be breached. It does not require good people becoming as evil as the people they sought to defeat. It does not require it turning out like Orwell’s Animal Farm where the animals toppled their brutal and greedy masters only to become like them or to twist moral codes. 

All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others. 
One philosophy above others that is worth remembering is that I could be wrong on my take on good and evil and what is permissible. I say this to warn not just you but myself to ensure I don’t become so sure that I am right while everyone else is wrong that I am good while others are evil. 

Maybe we should add to Edmund Burke’s quote the only necessary thing for the triumph for evil is for good men to do nothing…….or to become as evil as the men they are trying to stop.

"On the absurdity of consequentalism by everyone's favorite philosopher: L34derIt seems that it's getting more and more frequent for me to bump into here and see the trolley problem being discussed. What surprises me the most is that there are few who have taken the pains to study the origin of this thought experiment. So what should you care about dates and names and such? This isn't r/history although in a perfect world r/history and r/philosophy would be the same subreddit. 

But the fact remains that the trolley problem was originally conceived as a satire of consequentalist ethics by virtue ethicist Philippa Foot. The trolley problem has since changed into a kind of consequentalist propaganda that seeks to strip ethical philosophy to the bone by making it seem like abstract and frankly ridiculous thought experiments can answer fundamental questions on morality. So if the trolley problem is simplistic and unrealistic then what abstraction are we to choose to model our behavior on. The truth is that there are none because the experiments rely on the premise that you have power over people's lives, lots of power and you should know how to handle that power. Which is simply not the case for the average citizen. He has almost no power and lots of moral expectations to live up to.

To begin with there is one thing clearly wrong with the trolley problem if it is to be understood as a serious attempt at giving insight into our moral compass: Our moral compass although governed by a rational mind is not the Eye of Sauron. In the thought experiment we presume that the acting individual knows the train(potential threat) will not brake, all five(potential victims) will die(since apparently noone survives these sorts of accidents ever) and still despite your eye of omniscience you will see the workers as faceless automatons that you simply have to either save or kill. The joke Philippa Foot is getting at is that consequentalism reduces humans to robots with the value tag '1' hanging from their earrings. It wouldn't be 'wrong' to pull the switch if you cared about the workers and would feel sad about one of them having to die but let's rethink the thought experiment and yes the fat bastard is coming along with us although now i'm freely adding more details just like the other philosophers felt justified in.

So you arrive at the train station and you walk past the five railway workers. You smell something weird while you're walking past them and one of them is crouched up against the wall and it seems like he's injecting something...hmmm, hopefully just some insulin right? Then you spontaneously decide to wander into the control room(whatever i'm not familiar with the infrastructure) which happens to be empty and you can see that a train is fast approaching and is not slowing down. 'FUCK! There's no switch, what do i do?' Then you see the fat man..wait isn't this Gerry Manders, yeah you recognize him from the newspaper. He helped fund dozens of children charities and anti-gang initiatives in Detroit and L.A. He started his own business and hardly keeps a percentage for himself!(although he's a little greedy on the fatty foods) Well he's standing on the edge of the platform and by pushing him onto the rails he'll save the workers or well, you'll save the workers! Full of guilt you start approaching him from behind. Just as you're about to push him he turns around with this big, heart-warming smile full of joy.''Now i couldn't help notice you approaching me good fellow'' he says as he tips his hat and offers you a cigar.

Is this still the same thought experiment? Furthermore, do consequentalists realize that they're not the only ones concerned with consequences? What differentiates Deontologists and Virtue ethicists from consequentalists is that the former seek good consequences from strict conduct or developing one's virtues whereas consequentalists seek it through raw action based on calculations that may or may not be accurate. Does anyone really think Immanuel Kant wasn't concerned about preventing lies and murder when he provided his categorical imperative.?

Although i don't consider the categorical imperative to be perfect is it inconceivable that killing in the name of good can lead to others thinking that feeling justified in killing someone makes it just? The last point that i would like to invoke so that you may finally escape my rant is this: What separates consequentalism from nihilism? 

A consequentalist may berate you for taking incorrect action but can he give a convincing account of why it is incorrect? Will he make reference to human rights as to why the universal value tag earmark(1) is correct and then say that human rights must be broken from time to time in order for them to work. Why not the value tag 0? The nihilist has no pretense, if every rule can be bent there are no rules and trying to maximize or stabilize a population's size is not ethical considerations but calculus.

"What would be your version of the Three Laws of Robotics?This is my first post to /r/philosophy, so let me know if this constitutes 'idle musing' or is not quite right for the subreddit :)

The science-fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote extensively on the theme of integrating artificially intelligent robots into human culture. Given that these robots could potentially be vastly superior to humans in intelligence and/or physical endurance, he developed the following system of rules (impossible to circumvent) to ensure human safety alongside robot effectiveness:

* A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
* A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
* A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

In some of his novels, Asimov also proposes a 'zeroth' law with highest precedence - ""A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm"".

If a robot has no choice but to violate a law (for example, if it can only save one of two people), it chooses the outcome which would minimise the expected amount to which a law is violated (it would save the person most likely to survive, all else being equal; and would let one person die in order to save two).

Several authors, including Asimov, have pointed out ways in which these laws might be less than foolproof. Naturally, a robot with incomplete information might incorrectly assess a situation and cause harm by accident. The terms 'human' and 'robot' are potentially ambiguous, as is the term 'harm' (does it, for example, include mental well-being?) and the method for conflict resolution is essentially utilitarian, which some might take issue with - a robot might decide that a benevolent dictatorship is the best way to prevent harm coming to humanity, for example.

In the book 'The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect', the effectively omniscient intellect in question interprets 'harm' to mean death and nothing else, and creates an eternal paradise to which all humans are consigned; this, of course, is in the long run essentially a hell.

I've spent ages trying to come up with a better system than Asimov's, and I haven't got anywhere. Including mental well-being in the definition of harm is problematic as firstly it is unclear how to quantify it in relation to physical harm, and secondly this would result in the robot in question putting all humans into a state of permanent, brainless pleasure. Hardly ideal.

I've tried to weigh in on my own question, but honestly I can't come up with anything and I'd be interested to hear what you guys have to say.

**TL;DR** - Help! Robots!

**EDIT 1:** See my comment for a proposed improvement to the rules."
"""Gaming"" vs. ""real world"" Alright so, sorry if this post is really ignorant.  I've never seriously studied philosophy and perhaps I should have posted this in r/askphilosophy, but it seemed like more of a discussion than a question to me.  And, it was sort of in response to something that I read on this subreddit. 

There was a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/13pjtz/the_philosophy_of_gaming/) on this subreddit a couple of days ago about gaming.  I was less than impressed with it, but joined the conversation a bit late and [my comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/13pjtz/the_philosophy_of_gaming/c767ur7) weren't seen by many people.  However, I wanted to discuss them and so I've collected my thoughts and presented them here.  Basically, some people dismiss that playing a video game is a legitimate experience.  I'm not so sure.

Let's talk about decisions and conversations, and more specifically: why it would be less valid to have a conversation in a video game than in real life.  
When having a pointed conversation with someone, you choose from a relatively limited number of possible phrasings to achieve basically the same question/challenge/statement etc that you desire.  The other person then responds. In the real world, the other person has a considerably larger pool of possible responses to draw from as compared to the at most dozen or so directions that a conversation can take in even the newest role-playing games.  But either way, no matter what response you get, we'll classify whatever the responder does as a response.  Does it cheapen the conversation to know that, in theory, the other person had only a relatively limited number of possible response?.  Does it cheapen the conversation to know that the possible responses were ""programmed in"" (our real world responses are very arguably programmed in as well are they not?), and have probably been experienced by other people before?  I can't think of any reason why it should.  And if the experience of the conversation is cheapened by these things, isn't it merely a matter of degrees between a conversation with a human and a robot, and not some hard line?  Or in other words, is the only difference between gaming and reality that games have yet to become complex enough to fool us at being reality? And what about when they can?

Go to http://cleverbot.com/ and have a conversation.  How is it different than having a conversation with any stranger through an instant messenger-type program?  Other than it being [imperfect](http://i.imgur.com/0UhNn.jpg)?  But what if it was perfect?  Is there something essential about it that makes it less of an experience?  I don't think so.  

From a solipsistic standpoint, the only argument against gaming vs the 'real world' is that currently the 'real world' offers the much fuller, richer, complex experience to the experiencer.  The real world offers smell, taste, touch, true first-person perspective.  What if one day we can simulate all of that?  In fact, what if one day we can create a stable enough, harmonious enough, technologically advanced enough society to willingly enter some Matrix-like reality that would be indistinguishable from the 'real world'?  What if we are in such a program now?  I guess this is what my whole post comes down to: are those not valid experiences just because we can acknowledge some other reality that some might find more true and valid?  I honestly can't think of a good reason why.     
  
So, I'm sorry I guess this just turned into a discussion about the Matrix which I'm sure no one wants.  Its just that, I play video games and I'm mildly interested in philosophy.  I have philosophized on video games before and when I saw the discussion on here and so many people content to call video games escapism.  Escapism, as wikipedia defines it is: ""mental diversion by means of entertainment or recreation, as an ""escape"" from the perceived unpleasant or banal aspects of daily life."".  I'm sure video games are used in this way very frequently.  But I think its a gross mischaracterization of the ""hardcore"" gaming community as a whole to say that this is the ""ultimate realization"" of gaming.  Role-playing gamers enter games with a sense of adventure and exploration, and excitement for the experiences that they are about to have and the people that they are about to meet, even if those ""people"" disappear when they aren't looking.  And its easy for someone who doesn't know what they're talking about to confuse all of that with just staring at a screen and fiddling with a controller.  That would be like saying that the Matrix, and the countless lives lived and died within there, was just being curled up in some red goop in a little tube.  "
"My friend and I exchange philosophical epistles to stay in touch.This one is ""On Evil""I’ve decided to write to you today, to discuss something that has been weighing quite heavily on my mind. I won’t pretend to be doing so with selfless motives; I enjoy this sort of talk, and I always jump at the chance to hone my writing abilities.

Since I have just spoken of “honing my writing abilities”, I will not allow myself an irresponsibly decorated introduction.

I am writing to you, dear friend, to discuss the Argument of Evil, and while I am well aware that you know the details of this argument, I will still summarize it in my own colloquial words. 

The world is full of murderers, rapists, liars, and villains of all sorts. Innocent children are murdered every year. People experience sorrow and pain of unfathomable intensity on a daily basis all throughout the world, and throughout the history of life itself. 
If someone COULD prevent such horror, especially at no cost to themselves, they would have the highest moral obligation to do so.  If someone cannot prevent these tragedies, then that person is not omnipotent.
If a god exists, then he is either impotent or evil.

This is the basic argument you will hear brought against the notion of god(or at least a benevolent god). My intention in this letter is not to defend the argument from evil, but rather to express my dissatisfaction with the best theological objections to it. 

It is so easy to allow emotion to commandeer ones faculties, and cause one to forsake clarity of thought, so I will try my best to avoid this perennial pitfall.

In my younger years, I never gave this argument much credit. I could dismiss it easily in a number of ways. As I aged, and I became exposed to the philosophies of academic Christians, my arsenal of responses to the problem of evil steadily increased. For the sake of convenience I will list the most common responses to the problem of evil below.

1.) Bad things happen to allow good things to come of them. I.E. ""When God closes one door he opens another"".

2.) God works in mysterious ways. (""We can't possibly understand why God does the things he does so let's just assume they are good"") This relates to the first argument but is slightly different.

3.) Bad things happen to remind us that we are sinful and must worship God. (""God made 9-11 happen to punish America for sinfulness"") A famous accusation of the late and not great Jerry Falwell.

- This next one is far and above the most sophisticated-

4.) God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

- The first argument can be discarded merely because of it’s blatant appeal to the future, and the third can be ignored because of its downright barbarism, as well as its inconsistency(Since it would require all non-Christian countries to suffer God’s wrath). 

The second and the fourth, however, have some value. 

The 2nd argument is obviously an appeal to ignorance, and yet I will give it a proper response because of it’s frequent use by noted apologists. I read an essay by the eminent Christian philosopher William Lane Craig on the problem of evil, and after suffering through his trademark wordiness, I saw that he was unable to avoid this appeal to ignorance.

He explain that as “finite, limited beings” we cannot possibly fathom the timeless, infinite God of the universe.

Forget, for a moment, how irritating this common religious response is, and look at it through the lense of your greatest ally; Reason. 

In general, the Christian responses to the argument from evil are always arguments of unavoidable victory. This means that they frame things in such a way so that if something good happens, it is God’s doing. However when something terrible happens, it is attributed to the mystery of God, or perhaps even the mischief of Old Nick. Victory is unavoidable.

This sort of thought reminds me of a passage from Voltaire’s Candide, which I will provide below.

“You see,” said Candide to Martin, “that crime is sometimes punished; that rascal of a Dutch captain met the fate he deserved.”
“Yes”, said Martin, “but was it necessary that the passengers on his ship should perish also? God punished that knave, the devil drowned the others”

Voltaire, with his merciless wit, rightly mocks this sort of childish thought. The idea that all good things are attributed to God, and all bad things find ownership elsewhere, is embarrassingly transparent and should not be given a second thought by the intellectually honest thinker.
 
We now move on to the most compelling rebuttal to the argument from evil, the 4th argument.

God allows bad things to happen, because it is these tragedies that make us appreciate love, beauty, family etc. We as humans would not be able to live in a perfect world with no pain or harm. We need the sadness to show us the beauty of happiness etc. “There is no light without dark/hot without cold etc""

I first heard this argument put forth by prominent Cambridge mathematician and apologist John Lennox. Lennox has been referred to as the “closest thing to a modern C.S. Lewis”, and is a rare example of a respected Christian Scientist( A Christian who is a scientist, not the outrageous hallucinations of Mary Baker Eddy). He used the 4th argument in a debate with Christopher Hitchens, and I felt as though his argument was not properly scrutinized. Here is the link to their debate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH68Y5MUGfo

The reason Lennox’s argument went uncontested is because Hitchen’s actually shares this belief. In Hitchens' book Letters to a Young Contrarian, he attacks the idea of universal accord, and states that disagreement is what makes life worth living. He explains how dull and meaningless a world would be where there is no contrary thought or competing ideas. Hitchens didn’t think to contest Lennox’s argument because he holds the same belief. This, I believe, caused him to miss the problem with Lennox’s idea.

If you haven’t seen the glaring contradiction in Lennox’s argument yet, I will not delay any longer in revealing it to you. 

Lennox claims that a world without any pain, or any disagreement, would be a robotic world in which love, peace, and happiness mean nothing. That without their opposites they have no definition. The problem is that the Christian doctrine idealizes this very type of world in the concept of heaven. Christians yearn for an Eternal Paradise where there is no sorrow or suffering. They “take no thought for the morrow” because Christ will undoubtedly return in their lifetimes. To Christians, this life is simply passing scenery on the path to paradise. The core Christian belief in heaven directly contradicts the 4th argument. 

I happen to agree that a Nirvana of this sort is as inconceivable as it is undesirable. A place where all people share the same opinions, and dissension is nowhere to be found, is not a place that I would want to exist in even if it were a possibility. It would be robotic, unconscious, and inhuman.

The problem for Christians is that the Bible does not agree with this sentiment, and so the 4th argument cannot be used by those Bible believing Christians who so love to use it.

The notion of heaven is the key to dismantling the 4th argument.

I am an agnostic who is quite friendly to the idea of Deism, and so I am not entirely convinced by the argument of evil. I look forward to hearing your thoughts dear friend, and I hope they will bring some clarity to this most difficult topic. 

Warmest regards to you and your family.

"Can killing in the name of good be justified when innocents may also be harmed?During a sleepless night, I typed this out. It is a description of my internal conflict with being a contracted hacker for the government and the morality of my actions. 

**Background Info:**
I am 17. I work for a network security company that does contracting for the government. My work involves gaining access to a specific target using vulnerabilities in consumer devices. Since I do not a have a clearance I am given no information about the target.

**Start:**
I want to know I’m doing the right thing. Because what I do makes me a killer. Not directly, but ultimately what I do may or may not end someone else’s life. Work that I do with law enforcement can put a pedophile behind bars or work with the military can put a bullet through someone’s head in Afghanistan. It wasn’t like this before. Before, it was just the excitement of solving the puzzle, finding that one flaw that would give you unauthorized access. It didn’t feel quite real, at least not until the sudden realization that what I am doing actually affects people’s lives. The realization changes the “I just bypassed the security on that webcam” to “I just got a visual id on the target.” It’s been some months since I realized this and now I can’t stop asking myself the question: “Am I doing the right thing?” 

Personally, I do not believe that our government always makes the right decisions. Our elected officials are people just like us and are likely to make decisions that further their own agenda rather than do the “right” thing. Most of the time, there is no consensus on what the right thing is. There is so much conflict within the government that I cannot believe that without a doubt, the actions it makes are completely justified. What I do to help it can either be good or evil. Did hacking into some foreign computer network help the military kill someone? Maybe. Was he a terrorist? Who knows. I’d like to think that by providing the military with more information, I make it less likely for them to make a mistake, but I can’t be certain of that and I can’t be certain that the target deserved to die. 

So how do I justify my actions to help an entity that punishes people when my faith in its ability to do so fairly is lacking? I have to assume that it makes the correct decisions. I need to tell myself that when my software breaks into someone’s home network, that I am helping society by removing those who cause harm. I tell myself that each network I break into means that there is some little kid won’t be hurt. That one girl won’t have to live the rest of her life in silence and shame because she is scared to speak out. I pray that my work isn’t being abused to help spy on those who are innocent or worse, kill those who are innocent. It’s a huge burden that I place on a single assumption.  

I need to feel verification that I have done the right thing, that even if someone was harmed because of me, it was worth it because many more avoiding suffering. This need makes the words people that say to me have so much more meaning than they intend. Acceptance by others is verification that I have done the right thing while rejection proves that I have made a mistake. Hearing someone say that they trust me puts me in a blissful happiness. On the other hand, the words, “You’re not the right one for me. I just want to be friends” becomes a soul-crushing “You had good intentions, but you have made a terrible mistake and I can’t accept that.” Being aware of my unwarranted translation does nothing to mitigate the feelings it stirs up. I vividly remember a breakup where I was told, “I feel like you are using your depression to take advantage of me.” The shock that put through me was enormous. I had been able to feel like I was doing the right thing by demonizing rapists, pedophiles, generally anyone who takes advantage of others for sex. Now, to be heard that I was one, completely ripped my mind apart. Someone that I cared for did not want to be with me because she thought I was one of them. The rest of the day was spent contemplating quick and painless ways of suicide while a friend ineffectively tried to convince me that it wasn’t true. Honestly, the only thing that saved me was probably the fact that I felt so useless that I couldn’t bring myself to do anything.

Dealing with people has an extra level of difficulty, especially with people who don’t quite understand what I do. It seems that whenever people at school talk about me, the subject is always how much money I make. I have even had several people I do not normally talk to come up to me and inquire about my yearly salary. One such person even friend requested me on Facebook shortly after asking. This question disgusts me. My work decides if people live or die and people’s main concern is gossiping over how much money I make? Is only my pay important? How about catching those pedophiles, is that important? Is it worth the damage I might cause? Am I causing other people’s deaths for the money? I hope not. Just the idea of it sickens me. So I started using a large portion of my paycheck to buy toys for kids in hospitals. I remember when I was learning to program, my brother was in the hospital. The everyday before visiting him, I would frantically be programming a game to let him play on my laptop when I went to visit. He was so excited when he got to play my simple board game. I hope the money I got from my gamble at least brings a smile to others like the one my brother had. At least this helps me hold on to what sanity I have, but the toll this conflict is having on me is becoming more apparent.

I go through most days robotically. I wake up in the morning, go to school, go to work, go home, pass out, then stay up all through the night. Why? Sleep is a curse. I only sleep when my body can no longer handle being awake any longer since my dreams are painful. Some nights I dream of being punished for the fates I’ve brought to others, some nights I dream that I can no longer handle it and kill the ones I know who are guilty, and some nights I dream I am back in the asylum where I belong. If I am lucky, I don’t dream. I am in a different state of mind every day. I may go a few days feeling on top of the world while, on other days, I feel wretched and useless. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone. I can’t stand being unable to control my thoughts and feelings. I can’t help but let my personal relationships be intertwined with my conscience. My aim has always been to protect those who cannot protect themselves and spread happiness to those who suffer. The constant conflict in my mind leaves me lost and confused. I am sorry to those around me that I hurt because I am blind and those who I do not know because I am mistaken. Am I doing the right thing? Did I make the right choice?"
