"['There\'s the distinction between regularities in nature that are described by an (often mathematical) rule but without any rule following, and people who are genuinely following a rule. E.g. a falling object\'s position being a function of the square of time, without the object itself following a mathematical rule. \n\nWittgenstein\'s idea is that statements of facts following such an observation (for instance the empirical, experiential observation that if you put three coins together with five coins you\'ll repeatedly count eight coins) can be fixed to become rules, independent of any observation. Experiential statements can be negated, and can be placed in space and time - you\'ll find this sort of an observation, testing the type of a statement, interspersed throughout the work. It makes sense to say, I put together three coins and eight and counted eleven ten minutes ago, but it doesn\'t make sense to say three plus eight was eleven ten minutes ago. \n\nThe distinction bears on computation. Wittgenstein observes that Turing\'s machines aren\'t machines at all, but men performing the appropriate computations. A pocket calculator doesn\'t calculate at all. People calculate (with the calculator). Wittgenstein\'s (beautiful) imagery is wild animals stepping accidentally on the buttons of a calculating device - nothing is calculated. Similarly a chess program doesn\'t play chess. Only people play, at all. \n\nThe same sort of confusion is rife in the sciences, where brains (of humans and animals) are often found to unexpectedly calculate one thing or another. Suppose you write a program that guides a robot arm to throw a basketball at a hoop, say using differential equations or whatever. It doesn\'t follow at all that the human brain of the basketball player knows to use differential equations or whatever math is required, which the player may not be aware of. The brain of a human doesn\'t calculate anything. People calculate, with a brain, if and when they pursue higher mathematics, not when playing basketball. Just like the falling object merely conforms with the square function, so the basketball player\'s motions merely conform to certain advanced maths, and tracing these motions up nerve fibers and into the brain will only produce more and more ""mere conforming.""']"
"['> With that said, I\'m doubtful that there can really be memory and reaction without perception. \n\nThat\'s interesting. We can make simple robots that have memory and reaction, but I doubt anyone would say such a robot has perception. Google finds papers arguing that [bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2264733/) and [communities of microbes](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200428093506.htm) can form memories. That doesn\'t convince me that they have anything resembling conscious perception.\n\nEDIT: would you say that individual neurons have (individually) some kind of perception? \n\n> And yes, just as Leibniz, I would have no issues saying that all that exists, down to the principles responsible for activity in physics, also participates in perception (though of a significantly duller variety).\n\nIs ""participates in perception"" the same thing as *having* perceptions? Or is it like saying that photons participate in our visual perceptions?', '> That\'s interesting. We can make simple robots that have memory and reaction, but I doubt anyone would say such a robot has perception.\n\nI don\'t see how robots could have real memory. You might say they have it if you define memory in purely functionalist terms. But, suffice to say, I don\'t think that is real memory. At most, it just resembles or replicates real memory.\n\n> Is ""participates in perception"" the same thing as having perceptions? \n\nYes\n\n> Or is it like saying that photons participate in our visual perceptions?\n\nNo I\'m not saying that.

What more would be needed in order for that to be ""real"" memory? \n\nTo have a *perception* of a memory obviously requires something more than just a change of state representing an external stimuli, but I would say that robots (at least any that we can currently make) and bacteria are in the same boat there. \n\n \n\n> Though I would be saying that there is a unique way light perceives the world.\n\nHow would you define perception such that an individual particle could be said to perceive anything?

What more would be needed in order for that to be ""real"" memory? \n\nHow? A robot is just a complex machine. It\'s fundamentally just an assemblage of parts.\n\nIt doesn\'t think or remember any more than a calculator can actually add or subtract numbers, or any more than a book can read what is written in it.\n\nTo be actually remembering would require an act of having an inner representation of a past experience. \n\n> How would you define perception such that an individual particle could be said to perceive anything?\n\nAs I said before, a representation of the many, all that is other to some being, in said being. An act whereby its relations to everything else are unified.\n\n> A photon doesn\'t change in response to anything. \n\nI don\'t think that\'s true.

It's just a machine bumping into a wall.\n\n> It has an inner representation of that event\n\nNo? If you already agree that the roomba has no cognition, I don't see in what way it could represent anything or have an inner sense.\n\nAgain, I don't think what you are saying can make sense unless memory is conceived in an entirely functionalist manner.\n\n> Photons can interact with things, but there's no internal state change for the photon itself. (The same for a neutron, so the fact that photons travel at the speed of light, and the implications of that, aren't essential here.)\n\n> What does it mean for an object to perceive some interaction, if there's no change internally for that object as a result of that interaction? \n\nTo start, don't you think we've drifted off a bit too much? I'm not sure I see how this is helpful to the core discussion OP asked about.\n\nAnyway, I think you're confusing the fact that its inherent physical properties (like mass, charge, spin, and so on) won't change with the fact that it experiences no change whatsoever. Certainly, its relative position to other things will change, and I imagine it is exactly this they are perceptive of. If anything, when considered from such a monadic pov, they are in constant change, and what we see as constant physical properties are more the ways this change is regulated rather than some hard, metaphysically inscribed property.\n\n\n> And if something as basic as an elementary particle has perception of some sort, then wouldn't the simple robot as well?\n\nA class full of students isn't itself conscious just because the students are individually.\n\n> Wouldn't everything?\n\nAt the very least, what we represent as the parts of things would, yes.\n\n> Are we heading toward panpsychism here?\n\nLeibniz is a pretty hard panpsychist so, again, yes.""]"
"['The meaning of the word dog is known through sense perception, which is a material process. Those sensations can be described using physics, which is a computation. Those sensations are stored in memory, which can also be described using computations. \n\nI am claiming that what people are calling ""meaning"" and ""semantics"" are the memories of those sensations. I think the mistake Searle made is by assuming that AI researchers mean ""set var = dog"" when what they meant was ""set var = dog, and dog is this collection of sensations in memory"". Everything in this process is just a collection of symbols. \n\nThe references to an irreducible ""meaning"" strikes me as the introduction of a supernatural element. It is like a religious person claiming the ""god in the gaps"". Searle wants to say that even though the system of the Chinese room is externally identical to a mind, it isn\'t a mind because it doesn\'t understand. But what is this understanding? Define it precisely. If it really is something that exists, then it must be something physical. If it isn\'t, then it seems like Searle\'s purpose is to hold on to the idea of an immaterial soul.\n\nTangentially, consider a robot dog that has been programmed to mimic all the behaviors of a biological dog. Is it ok to abuse that robot? Shouldn\'t our empathy extend to everything that can apparently feel pain? I am concerned that Searle\'s argument will be used in the future to justify committing moral outrages against AIs.']"
"['It\'s a pretty general question, but as a place to start:\n\nPhilosophy is often about clearly and rigorously examining issues of fundamental importance. Philosophy isn\'t a type of specific vocational training. It helps you think clearly about what\'s important in life, how inquiry works, and the history of intellectual development. Philosophy hones your writing, speaking, and critical reasoning skills. It allows you to both give and take criticism. It grants you the time and training to form developed positions in ethics, politics, epistemology, metaphysics, and loads of other things. It can give you the appropriate balance of confidence and humility to stake out a claim, defend it, and see possible objections. You have, like, maybe 80 years on this planet. Maybe don\'t waste it solely making widgets, or pushing buttons, or crunching numbers, or selling apps, or figuring out how to get more ads into peoples\' heads. Doing philosophy gives you a chance to hold reasoned views about essential and perennial questions. The alternative is to walk around in a confused haze, struggling to understand how things are at a fundamental level, unable to articulate what you think, and becoming angry and defensive when confronted with arguments you don\'t know how to answer.\n\nTo give some concrete examples of the value of philosophy: the works Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum have been influential when it comes to issues of economic development. The work of Larry Temkin has been influential in certain fields of developmental economics, resource allocation, health care, etc.\n\nThe work of Rawls has influenced political systems.\n\nThe development of fuzzy logic has a number of practical implications and is employed somewhat frequently.\n\nThe work of Singer, Regan, and others has heavily influenced what we think about animal rights.\n\nThe ""philosopher\'s brief"" is a famous amicus curiae by Ronald Dworkin, Thomas Nagel, Robert Nozick, John Rawls, Thomas Scanlon, and Judith Jarvis Thomson on euthanasia.\n\nLots of philosophers influence bioethics, and play roles in hospitals, policy boards, think tanks, centers, etc.\n\nOther philosophers have influenced things like environmental policy, interactions with native populations, issues of reparations, affirmative action, abortion, welfare, taxes, and so much more.\n\nAnd now we have philosophers working heavily in AI, robot ethics, drones, big data, and a host of other recent technological issues.\n\nAnd that\'s just a smattering of things in the last 40 years or so. If you want to go back farther, we can give a general sort of answer: philosophy looks to have played a pretty big role in, say, the founding of countries, the development of economic systems, the crafting and interpretation of laws, the developments in literature and art, the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, political science, economics-- And, yes, in the natural sciences. Think of almost any big development, and philosophy will probably be in the background, if not the foreground. So, like, relativity, women\'s rights, evolution, human rights, democracy, animal rights, cost-benefit analysis, religious views, the scientific method, set theory, quantum mechanics, developmental economics, the capabilities approach, theories of welfare. Major impacts on what people believe even if most people don\'t recognize it.']"
