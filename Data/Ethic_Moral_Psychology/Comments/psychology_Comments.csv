"['Hmm. Most people experience it throughout their lives for brief periods of time...that\'s the tired, ""zoned out"" feeling you get after an argument, or the tiredness you feel after completing a stressful task at work, the one where your brain completely shuts off, your mind is blank and you kinda go on auto-pilot mode until you get to properly rest from it...\nAlso, you can pay attention to how you feel/your mind works whenever you experience something you perceive as \'traumatic\' at the given moment- it doesn\'t have to be actual trauma or PTSD, just in a sense that it\'s something unexpected/shocking/unfamiliar- usually people feel a seperation between their thoughts&feelings and actions at times like that- that\'s why you only realize something traumatized you after a certain time has passed...because when you\'re in some kind of danger for example, the mind has to shut off for you to go into fight/flight mode- the priority is to save yourself and get you out of immediate danger. Some call it \'adrenaline\', and while you probably feel hyper-aware and clear-minded while dealing with danger, that\'s possible because your body makes a choice to shut off your thoughts/emotions so you can focus on what\'s happening- otherwise, you\'d be overwhelmed with feelings of shock and confusion, triggering a bunch of emotional reactions and chaotic thoughts that would absolutely debilitate you- you probably experienced the latter as well at one point or another- where you become physically paralyzed, unable to take any type of action due to the overwhelming flow of emotions & thoughts, at the mercy of your current circumstances.\nYou probably found yourself in both situations I\'ve described above, so you can most likely identify with both the super focused person whose only concern is resolving the situation at hand AND the person who was left incapacitated due the weight of their overwhelming emotions/thoughts at a certain point in your life. \nWell, dissociating is a bit like a mix of the two-  just going through the motions while performing everyday tasks, mindlessly, like you\'re spaced out...it feels like there\'s constant fog in your brain, so it\'s kind of like your mind doesn\'t really register your actions- As if it was actually foggy and you couldn\'t see! So, while in reality, you\'re just taking small steps in the direction you believe\'s right,  what you\'re really focused on and consciously working on in your mind is trying to make out your surroundings by concentrating your eyes reeeally hard- and then making logical conclusions based on the information collected by your senses...Usually, when going somewhere, people are preoccupied with something that\'s directly connected to that particular action- like the destination (for example: are you excited or nervous about arriving?) or the time (for ex. worrying if you\'ll be late), pacing yourself (for example: trying to hurry, to avoid being late), or physical sensations (feeling tired at your current pace). Even when you\'re distracting yourself while walking, like for example calling a friend to keep you company, it\'s BECAUSE you have time to kill and you feel bored while physically making your way to your next stop- you\'re also actively paying attention to traffic etc. In a fog, you\'re misssing crucial information related to your movement, so the mind is working overtime to figure these out- your physical movement is automatic, and feels completely separate from the mental process. While usually it goes something like: ""green light = can move forward > proceed to cross"", in a fog, the thought process goes something like: ""Is that a traffic light? Which color? > *Can identify it\'s green* > that means I\'m supposed to cross the road > which road is this supposed to be again? > *identify probable address* What\'s supposed to come after this crossing? Am I still going in the right direction?"" Etc. Etc. \nSee the difference? In a fog, the actual decision to walk across the crossroad isn""t even consciously registered- there\'s a completely detached intetnal monologue going on in your head the entire time... Yet you\'re still doing the walking part, all while following traffic codes and pre-established routes- if you\'re going by car, you\'re even managing to drive properly! Basically, you\'ve automatized your actions in oder to boost your cognitive operation. \n\nTLDR-\nThat\'s mostly how you function while dissociating. (Applicable for both prolonged dissociation and brief episodes) You\'re doing all the things you should be doing- and even subconsciously intend to do- but you\'re just mentally not present. \nYour mind is basically taking a nap lol\n...and you\'re going through life like a robot, \'cause your brain\'s constantly running on power-saving mode... It only sends you commands, like a programmer writing code- until everything\'s running smoothly, it\'s remotely forwarding basic instructions crucial for the system to operate undisturbed with its status permanently set on ""away""...it\'s only when there\'s a disturbance in the controlled system, such as an error or a crash that it activates itself to normal capacity. \n...if that makes sense.']"

"['The first few years my husband and I dated he was playing rugby on a mens club team. He was obsessed with it. All of his friends were on the team because he moved to our city after college so these people were all he knew. I grew up in our city and went to college and grad school here so my friend circle was a variety of people from a variety of contexts i picked up over the years. My husband (then boyfriend) is a very social extroverted guy and was always happy to go out with my friends. Unfortunately it didnt take me long to realize that i absolutely hated going out w his rugby friends. Individually they were mostly nice fun guys but they were rarely around me as individuals - it was all the big group gatherings at bars and peoples houses. I realized i was drinking a lot out of boredom just to get thru those nights. I finally was open in that i didnt like going to rugby functions - that all the guys do nothing but talk about rugby. and the wives or gfs that were routinely out w the rugby guys were this strange breed of women that seemed to follow their husbands/bfs to every game in town or out of town and were like robots who have clearly just adhered to their rugby guys lifestyle completely, so they had so little to talk about. it bred a lot of resentment amongst my husband bc he was convinced i was “antisocial”. I promised it was just that these otherwise nice/fun people were boring AF as a group, to anyone not as into rugby as him. I even invited them to gatherings with my friend groups and they would all tend to stick with each other and talk to my friends like it was a rugby party that my friends were crashing. \n\nI was relieved when my huaband “retired” from that hobby, just bc of that dynamic. i was worried theyd abandon him once he wasnt playing rugby anymore, since this giant group of “close” guys actually didnt seem to connect w one another on a more personal level, and unfortunately i was correct. Hes really grown apart from all but like one of them. but he def stopped acusing me of being antisocial and difficult when he was out of the bubble and had to make friends more organically like i did']"

"['Sure.\n\nI began using weed when I was around 15-16 years old (can\'t remember the exact date) at a time when I was kinda messed up. I had a ""normal"" material life but was very inexperienced in social interactions, so I mostly played videogames with some friends from school and was not a very kind person. I had anger issues (probably because of the videogames as I frequently became irritated when I lost or died) and I was kinda paranoid that my friends did not like me and treated me badly, which sometimes happened but other times it was just in my mind. I also had some kind of mental block when talking to people, like a full out war was going on insinde my mind when I tried to figure out what to say (this is important). This is the mental background of who I was, although I cannot express the reality in a quick text.\n\nAfter a while I went to a rave and was introduced to ecstasy, and not long after I began using LSD (I think I was 17 at the time). The feeling I had while using LSD was amazing, and I could literally feel that a heavy boulder was taken off my back (probably the blocked energy I had accumulated throughout the years was liberated). That mental block and internal war I cited simply vanished and I felt that I could really express myself as I truly was, without any restrains. I was able to speak the thoughts I had and could interact with anyone, which I was not able to do normally. For me this was a VERY needed experience.\n\nNot surprisingly, I became addicted to that sensation and liberation and instead of trying to improve myself to achieve it in the normal life, I began using LSD more often. And then things just went downhill fast. It is actually pretty difficult for me to talk about it as it left a scar in my mind, I don\'t like to remember but I guess I must face it sometimes to overcome it.\n\nOne day me and my friend were doing a tab of LSD and it hit differently. I don\'t know what the dealer put in the tab (I always took the pure one) or if he had put more than usual, but it hit much stronger. It was night and we were at the backyard of my apartment complex and decided to go to his house walking. Fucking walking haha. His house was like 2 km from mine and it was night. Naturally, I had a very bad trip.\n\nWhen we turned at some street, everything was suddenly stretched all pulled diagonally, I began thinking that my friend was a robot and that I was trapped in the matrix. I actually thought that I figured things out but that I wasn\'t supposed to, so I felt like something from the ""real world"" was coming for me on the outside. And then my vision broke down into four and they began spinning. At this time I noticed that I was having a mental breakdown or something serious like that and began asking for my friend to tell me where we were so that I could localize myself externally and internally. After some time things became a little better and I went back home by uber, and some other things happened that are not important.\n\nNot satisfied, I used more LSD after some time and, once again, things went badly. At some point in the trip, I felt like I was being detached from this ""screen"" that represents our vision, but I somehow forced myself to come back, but when I did, the screen broke (that is, my vision broke) and restored itself in a matter of 2 seconds. That was terrifying to me. Not only that, but my thoughts had changed. I began thinking about very deep aspects about existence and reality, but my mind was not prepared for such fundamental thoughts and that destabilized me deeply. I can\'t express their depth with words, but some doors simply must not be opened yet, and I feel like I forced some of them to open and reached the wrong conclusions. At some point I felt like I was NEVER going to get out of some thoughts I had, as if the mental damage I had done to myself was never going to be healed and that I was going legit crazy. I almost did, I felt the limit of reason as if it was palpable; like, just a little more and I wouldn\'t be able to go back. Nothing can even begin to compare with the amount of fear I felt at that moment.\n\nThat left a scar in me and affected my sober self very deeply. After that I could not use any drugs (including alcohol and except cigarettes) without the same profound thoughts returning and the limit of reason becaming less solid. Eventually I stopped using everything and currently only drink coffee as a stimulant.\n\nI guess those experiences broke my old self enough for me to change into a better person, but this took years (I\'m now 22) and for a long time I could not function properly. I am grateful to God that I\'m now almost completely healed (I can\'t say completely yet as the memories create some disturbances within my mind).\n\nThis is it. So in my experience as a drug user, they can be very helpful when used in a controlled manner but there is always a risk of something going badly. I don\'t think it is worth it, as learning through day-to-day problems and challenges is much more pure and solid than the change that comes from using a drug.\n\nI hope my story helps you in some way!

"['This stance is very estranged from the reality of the condition. While I acknowledge some people don\'t have a choice but to act as their deficits require them to, it\'s not outside the realm of a narcissists life to acknowledge what they need and pick and choose their ""pursuits."" Intentionality is a trait lacked by numerous human behaviors including self sabotage. Narcissists may often take actions that detract from their behavior as if they meticulously tuck away what they don\'t want to confront. If their values outline another behavior then they would be conflicted. It is alarming to think that only psychopaths or even anyone with a disorder would be manipulative as a forethought. It is important to discern that even narcissism develops from repeated choices. Many people even without the disorder have to make a choice to learn social skills in order to get along well with others. So, here we have an article concerning narcissism and it\'s manipulative tendencies. Since manipulation is an active verb, meaning there is an actor, someone will have to be the object of the verb. There is no need to word out ""it so happens that their behaviors manipulate someone,"" or ""their physiology causes them to ignore others well being."" Some people with psychological abnormalities come away from years of unhealthy growth with a strong desire to treat their nature as normal, and they should be granted that amount of respect for the deliberation in their choices should they find themselves to benefit from it. The fact is, if they want to orient the article to whether people have free will, if they are all robots or not, then it would be entirely of no contribution to the subject matter.']"
"['Learn how to do the tidying up that you are helping with correctly, yes I know that sounds bad but it’s true. This is long, but I hope it will help any men and women understand better.\n\nMy partner and I have a few understandings, he works 60-80hr work weeks with 1 day off and I work 30hr work weeks with 3 days off so I have the time to take care of the home. However I have physical job that is also mentally taxing, I have 3 days off because my body needs it to function. \n\nHe understands I need help around the home, and that what I ask of him is reasonable per our time, or he has to do it because I can’t (He has access or knowledge to fix). Things like, adding soap to the washer and turning it on, feeding the cats when he gets home, taking out the garbage, help me bring in the groceries, water change the fish tanks (once every two weeks). \n\nThe problem comes in when I need more help, or he offers and try’s to help. \n\nHere is an example: He got an extra day off, the night before he said he’d clean up the house while I was at work tomorrow. When I got home, he was so proud of himself for “helping”.\n\nHe picked up the cat toys from the floor, the empty boxes that need to be taken to the trash and put them on the couch so our robot vacuum could clean the floor, which he ran 3 times “to really get the floor clean”. He had done the dishes, which was emptying the clean dishwasher, loaded it and left the large cumbersome ones that he said he’d clean last week, on the counter untouched. Again.\n\nHe did the water change on the fish tanks, but didn’t clean his pre filter sponges or filter (once a month) so I still have to maintain the tanks and have to do another water change anyway. \n\nWhile doing the dishes, he got distracted by his video games and left the water on, flooded the kitchen and used all of our clean towels to get the floor. He didn’t use the “fish towels” the ones we have specifically for water spills from the aquariums or situations like this. \n\nHe then did 3 loads of laundry, 1 load of our work  clothes, which once dry he did not hang up, he placed in the laundry basket on our bed, so everything is wrinkled and needs to be run through the dryer again with a wet cloth for an hour. \n\nAnd 2 loads of our towels he used for the floor, that he let sit in the washer for half the day so they have to be re washed so they don’t have the mildew smell, and then the second set of towels that sat in the dryer, only ran once so they aren’t dry and have the same issue as the ones in the washer. The rest of the used towels are in the bathtub, we have 1 bathroom/shower, so they have to be moved for either of us to use the shower before or after work. \n\nSo to summarize his “helping” made a fuckton of more work for me. What I needed help with was not done, and what he did do was not helpful. \n\nThe floor being clean is a moot point if I have to still put the cat toys away, take out the trash so I can sit down on our couch where all the items are to relax after my work day. \n\nThe dishwasher being ran is a moot point when I have to take everything out from under the sink to clean up excess water from flooding the kitchen, while salvaging our cleaners and boxes under the sink that have water damage that I need to repurchase and go to the store again. None of the large pots or pans are cleaned and are sprawled on the counter so I have nothing to cook dinner with or counter space to cook or to put the groceries on.\n\nThe aquariums are a moot point because I have to take care of the filters and pre filters before they clog, which will cause me to have to do a water change due to waste floating in the tank.\n\nThe laundry is a moot point since I have to rewash all of the towels, including the ones he washed and “dried”. I have to take care of the towels and the ones in the bathtub before I can use the shower or the dryer so my work clothes can be presentable that are in the laundry basket.\n\nNow I will spend my days off cleaning and fixing everything, while he parades around like a peacock for helping on one of his rare extra days off. \n\nThe only thing I gained out of his help was “clean” floors, and 1 load of clean dishes put away. \n\nAnd hours of rework for clean floors that I could of done myself in 30mins.\n\nI love my man, he works very hard for our family, he provides a good life for us. \n\nBut for Christs sake… it’s like having a teenager that isn’t my own kid who breaks our stuff that I can’t punish who talks about how great he is and legit doesn’t know better, because his own parents didn’t teach him how to.\n\nI’ve been taking care of or helping with housework and laundry since I was 8, he is 34. \n\nI have to matter of factly explain to him why all his hard work isn’t helpful, after the fact over the next couple weeks (in small chunks with verbal how to’s and visual as well). I have to literally teach him, when I expect adults to know what to do, because my dad did… but I also forgot that my grandma did actually teach my dad how to clean and my mother taught me over years how to do it right. \n\nAnd yes, these are basics that he either should already know how to do, or knows how to do (like cleaning the fish filters or hanging up clothes so they don’t wrinkle). So my expectations are not out of proportion. \n\nAnd no he usually doesn’t flood the kitchen, which obviously would have made all of these things less likely to cascade into a total clusterfuck. Except the poor guy flooded the kitchen again this week, when he tried to help with the dishes. He went to the bathroom to pee and left the water was running, one of the pans moved creating a water slide… to our floor. \n\nSo please, when you try to help your spouse make sure you are helping or ask and learn how to. It isn’t as hard as it sounds, we do appreciate the effort, and in the long run it pays in dividends when it’s done right. \n\nI would have been thrilled if all he’d done was all the dishes and taken out the garbage. \n\nI would have been elated if he did that and cleaned the floors and the aquariums. \n\nI would have been sopping my panties if he’d hung up the clothes on top of it. (Which doesn’t mean much, as I am the high libido person in the relationship, thus the one who wants sex regularly)\n\nWe don’t need perfection, we just need help with the burden of running a home sometimes. At least for me and my experience with friends and family. \n\nAnd if you are raising kids, especially boys, for fucks sake teach them how to properly do household chores and house work. Bras go in undergarments bags, like colors with like colors, if you miss the toilet or dribble please clean it up so I don’t step in it when I have to sit down to pee.']"
